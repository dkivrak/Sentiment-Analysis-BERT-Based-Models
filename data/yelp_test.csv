"This is a rundown on the hotel as I did not play in the casino or bars.  I stayed in a \""""Hollywood Hip\"""" room.  \nAbsolutely nothing special about this hotel - run of the mill.  You will get nothing more than the room for your money.\n$14 for internet connection in room\n$25 to use the fitness room?  That is only a $10 discount for hotel guests.\nShower in adjacent room made so much pipe noise there was no sleeping past 6:00 am.\nLighting in rooms is dingy.  Not even a makeup mirror.\nCould not get a late check out even on a Tuesday morning with no big events going on.\nWhen are they going to make in-room safes big enough to fit a 15 inch laptop?\n\nMall adjacent has lots of stores but not as nice and not as simple to navigate as Caesar's Mall.  The best thing was the fella that stored my luggage.  He looked me in the eye and assured me my luggage would be kept safe.  I'm one for two - lost sleep but no lost luggage..",0
"I have been to a lot of restaraunts and worked in the hospitality industry for over 18 years and I can clearly state \""""THIS IS THE NASTIEST PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO.\""""  Right from the get go, the smell here is horrific.  Why did I not turn around right then you ask???? Great question,,, I am going to say that the stench is so overwhelming it puts you into a mild coma and you are not able to clearly function or think straight.  That caused me to to stay.  I was also having not such a good morning so I just gave in and figured something to eat would help.  I ordered a polish sausuage sandwich on sourdough.  Let's just say that the cup of mustard that was on this aboration was too much to handle.  I brought it up to the server who could care less excetp to say \""""Yeah, that's a lot of mustard\"""".  That was his solution.  \n\nSo in a nutshell:\n1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.\n2) The food cannot really be called that.  The slop they serve is litterally unedible.  \n3) The service staff has ZERO clue what service is and how to take care of anyone.  \n\nThis place should honestly be blown up.  What a pit of despair.",0
We heard so many good things about this place so we decided to try it. The menu looked amazing and we came hungry. I ordered kalua pig Benedict and my husband ordered adobo fried rice with Mac salad. Both were not good at all! The kalua pig Benedict was kalua pig and CABBAGE Benedict...totally gross no taste from the kalua pig and the English muffin on the bottom was soggy from water...if it was soggy from like a tasty liquid that would've been different but it wasn't. The adobo fried rice was junk. If you are from Hawaii and know good adobo fried this was not even close. We thought aloha kitchen AFR was junk this was worse. The Mac salad was DISGUSTING to say the very least. It had no taste and the macaroni tasted old. It was like soaked (not boiled) macaroni in a watery white substance. I gave this one star because we also ordered the red velvet pancakes and although it was a little dry it did taste good. We also got a side of zippy's chili which was about an ounce for $2.75 that tasted good (like zippys chili) so our bill came out to $47 and some cents and we were Very Very disappointed to have to pay that much for such a crappy meal.,0
"I ended up in the emergency room within an hour of eating here with a terrible allergic reaction to something.  I'm deathly allergic to shellfish and didn't order anything with shellfish in it which scares me that there is cross contamination with the shrimp in the kitchen. I will more than likely not be back, in fear that could happen again.",0
"AWFUL.  I am sorry I come from Edison, New Jersey where you have a lot of indian restaurants that are amazing including buffets with restaurant quality food.  I travel a lot and have to admit this is one of the worst Indian restaurants I have ever eaten.   Honestly I have had better Indian food in Kansas City. The food had no flavour.  I think my mom could cook better than this.  The buffet has no rhyme or reason to it,  there are choices like Fried fish and then you have paneer with some weird sauce and vegetables.  I eat Indian food twice a week and was really disappointed.  As I spoke to a few people in the restaurant, most were tourists so you get the impression that they probably do not have a lot of repeat clientele.  Would not recommend and will not go back.",0
"This place sucks.  Period.  I'm a big fan of buffet, and frankly this place is what makes people hate buffets.  Never again.",0
I had a group of 9.  The service was the absolute BEST compared to other places we dined.  The food was amazing and the Manager and our server Carmine took great care of us.  The majority of the table went with the chef's selection.  We all did $50 a head and the food came out.  It was an incredible experience and my palette thanks you.  The decor is hip and the music was to our liking  The sea-bass skewers?  OMG.  Everything was superb.  Only thing was when it was time to wrap up and close the bill.  Took a little longer than expected but still a great experience and we enjoyed our time there.,1
"My boyfriend and I came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon and waited for about 45 minutes before being seated. The wait was definitely doable, especially since the hostess takes your phone number and online updates are texted to you informing you how many parties are ahead of you. Once we were seated, our server was quick to take our orders and make us feel welcome. I ordered the LV burger and my boyfriend ordered the ABC burger - both were delicious. Finally, we had our frozen hot chocolate, and this treat alone made the high prices tolerable. This was definitely an awesome experience and is a must-do for people visiting Vegas.",1
"Called on a Thursday, they got me in the next day for my eye exam.  Had to wait a little, but the exam was quick, professional, and dead-on in terms of contacts and glasses prescription.  Selecting the frames was easy and they put together/priced a package for me in record time.  1 week because of custom lenses--and they were done and ready for pickup in exactly a week.  In the meantime the trial contacts had started to bother me so I called and asked if they could revert me back to my \""""old\"""" lens type with the new RX.  They did so willingly, ordered the trial lenses, and everything arrived on the same day to be picked up concurrent with my new lenses--which were perfect by the way.  Very happy with this location, particularly as I have had bad luck with other LensCrafters in other states in the past.  I'll keep coming here for my glasses needs!",1
"Wow, after checking out Yelp because we weren't that happy with other foot spas we've dropped in on, we found Bali!  These guys are amazing, best foot spa I've been to.  $20 actually includes neck, back, shoulders, legs, which usually doesn't happen.  I've been to foot spas where they've wanted at least $20 extra for that.  You get a full hour which is incredible.  Since my feet are ticklish I really look forward to the neck and shoulders so them including that in the price is worth everything right there.  We had Mark and Amy and they were so friendly and skilled at what they were doing.  The amazing thing was that Mark, knowing my feet are ticklish, was able to relax my feet to the point where I could enjoy it.  The atmosphere was peaceful and awesome too.  I love all the sparkling lights on the trees as you walk back.  The music was the perfect volume.  Everybody was friendly and treated you really well.  Whenever we have guests here in Vegas, we're taking them all to Bali.  And we'll tell all of our local friends too.  For the price you cannot beat this place or the people there!  We really felt well taken care of.",1
This is my go to location on the way to work. They are open super early and in the same direction that I'm travelling. I hate going out of my way.  The staff is very friendly and informative about their product offerings.,1
"So, it's New Year's Eve.  It's been one heck of a year, and I'm glad it's almost over.  I wake up, ready to start my day and go get my hair done, grab lunch with my girlfriend and then party the night away.  And then I discover the pool that is my garage.\nApparently, my water heater decided to die sometime in the middle of the night and drain the contents of it's body all over the floor.  RIP Heaty.  It's nine in the morning on new year's eve, and I'm panic stricken, trying to find a plumber to come out and either fix or replace it.  Thank gosh for Yelp and Water Heater Pros.\n\nI gave them a call and left a voicemail, and promptly got called back within ten or so minutes.  They asked me basic questions about my unit, assessed that it needed to be replaced and quoted me a price.  A great price in my opinion, given that the first company I had talked to wanted $300 more for the exact same thing.  He gave me a time of between 11:30-12:30, which was even better.  Same day service on a (almost) holiday?  Then to top it off, there was a knock at my door about 15 minutes before the time window - yay!  Not just on time, but early.\n\nI got to have Charlie work on my heater.  He confirmed it needed replacing, and after we talked briefly about the heater and what all needed to be done, I let him alone to work in peace.  Within about ninety minutes, he was all wrapped up and I still have time to make my hair appointment today.  \n\nI am amazingly pleased all around.  With Charlie's nice demeanor, his service, showing up early, and the pricing.  I'll definitely recommend Water Heating Pros to any friends that might get in a similar situation in the future.",1
"Agonizingly slow service. Tepid, mediocre food. Salsa from a jar.",0
"Before going into the Oyster Bar, I started to sniff the air right when I entered the casino near the restaurant to see if I smelled THAT fish smell. Anyone who has eaten seafood knows that concerning fish smell which serves as a warning to all of us to NOT eat from this establishment or you will be praying at the porcelain bowl for the next two days. However, I smelled nothing but seafood joy coming from Oyster Bar, so we went right in and started looking at their menu.\n\nI like Oyster Bar's menu because it isn't 18 pages long (a la Cheesecake Factory). One page of food, one page of booze, and we are good to go. I informed the server of my gluten allergy, and he was very careful and checked with the chefs (who work in an open kitchen two feet away from the tables)to make sure I could eat the dish. To play it safe, I got the House Combo Boil (Louisiana Style), and I was very surprised at how good it was. Sometimes Boils can be overly seasoned and are easily overcooked, but this one? Perfectly cooked, and seasoned in every way, The mussels were a decent size, and the crab and lobster were still tender and delicious.\n\nMy husband got the Cajun Peel and Eat Shrimp, and WOW. I could eat that all day long. I could have easily eaten a pound of that shrimp, amidst the pain of peeling each individual shrimp, happily on any day of the week. Once again, perfectly seasoned, great sauce and cooked just the way I like it. We also took two oyster shooters each which made us both intensely happy.\n\nNow if you're a seafood snob and come here you may comment that the seafood isn't as good as let's say Maine, RI, etc. However, you're off the Strip in a locals casino. Take it for what it is, enjoy the good service, very friendly chefs and delicious, fair-priced food that will satisfy most of our palettes. Also, who doesn't love cheesy lighted waterfalls and people watching?",1

"We are very disappointed with the management, as they refused to let our kids use their restroom. What kind of toy store doesn't let kids use its bathroom? They need to change their bathroom policy before we go back to spend our money there!",0
"How bad could this place be?\n\nWe waited 15 minutes in a booth a waitress never came to get a drink order say hi or anything else!\n\nI walked up to two managers that were rolling silverware to tell them how it was and they said \""""its a hard night tonight and give us a break\"""" they never said sorry or anything else avoid this place at all cost! I called to talk to management and they don't want to talk to you nor will they call you back, avoid all nugget's at all costs!",0
"We used to go here all the time.  We like eating dinner outside by the fire pits.  Their food is okay.  The last time we went here it was very busy for a Sunday night.  We waited over an hour for our food.  We came as a large group and there were 4 separate orders for our group.  The orders were done at the same time.  One of the orders had an appetizer that came out 10-15 minutes after their meal.  We knew that we wouldn't get our food at the same time however another order came out over 20 minutes later and the rest of us were already done eating.  That order was for 2 hamburgers and it's funny that there were other orders that had ordered after us that were also burgers and got their burgers first.  Even the customers who ordered after us that got their burgers first were saying it was ridiculous and that we should say something.  We understood it was a busy night but we felt like maybe they skipped the order or forgot to cook it.  We asked to talk to a manager who's name is \""""Megan\"""" and she was extremely defensive.  She just kept saying with an attitude \""""Sorry, it's a busy night\"""",  \""""I don't know what to tell you\"""", \""""what do you want me to do about it?\"""".  It didn't seem like she cared about customer service.  She was basically blowing us off and not sincere about her \""""Sorry\"""". It was excuse after excuse... she would say \""""well the numbers don't go in order\"""" then she said \""""it's because you ordered well done burgers\"""" (btw, we were never asked how we wanted our burgers cooked)...    We told her that we come here often and that after the way she was handling our complaint that we might not come back and she said \""""i think that's best\"""".  If this is the type of person that is representing this business, then it's bad for business.  If you make a mistake own up to it or sincerely apologize and try to keep your customer coming back.  We asked to talk to a general manager or the owner at a later date and she refused to provide a name or a phone number and said she was the only person to talk to and that the owner doesn't deal with stuff like this.  Which may be true but if she truly felt like she handled this situation appropriately then she would have no problem giving us the owner's name.  The manager Megan was rude, argumentative, impatient, and indignant.  After some debate she refunded us the order only per the kitchen manager's request and then asked us to leave the business.  Which we were glad to do after that experience.  Anyway to sum it up, the atmosphere is nice, the food is okay, the wait for food is very long on busy nights, and the Manager MEGHAN is awful!!!",0
"Wow!  I came as part of a group and LOVED it here.  I have been to other BYOB painting studios and thought I had completely enjoyed my experience.  They pale in comparison.  The set up, the ability to sit with your group, the studio size, the ladies that were working, the music... everything was fun and fantastic.  Time flew.  Paint was applied.  Conversations were had.  Art was made.  I will return.",1

"Art is good.  This however, was just okay.\n\nThis used to be the Guggenheim space, and then I loved it. I saw some truly breathtaking art but when it closed and now at the Da Vinci show, it was just okay. Small, a little depressing somehow, it just didn't work for me in comparison to the other options to see art in Vegas.\n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, the green screen pictures they take as you go in (or out depending on the line) are cheesy and they were having a hard time getting the technology to work, and then couldn't find our photo. In the end, for another $20 or more, I didn't get it and didn't feel sad about that at all.\n\nI'd go if the exhibit is something you're REALLY into, otherwise, I'd skip this one.",0
"I made a reservation for a full-size car for 6 days. My husband is tall (6'8\"""") so I knew we wouldn't be comfortable in a mid-size or smaller. I was happy to pay for the full-size and was happy with my quote of $166.70.\n\nWhen we arrived at the Las Vegas location at 9pm on a Wednesday night (in the middle of what our cab driver called \""""the dead season\""""), we were told there were NO full-size cars available. NONE!? None. \n\nThe rental agent offered us a \""""discount\"""" on an upgrade. We had budgeted our mileage into our trip (a 1,250-mile roadtrip to four national parks), so changing from our anticipated full-size car to an SUV, van or luxury sedan was going to be a big cost already. \n\nOur rental agent told us the Chrysler 300 got 31 mph (highway). Since we had few options, we went with that one. And paid $276 for the six days ($110 more than expected). The car's mileage was NOT 31 mph and was closer to 24 mph. \n\nI feel very manipulated and deceived. I know bait-and-switch is common for those renting sub-compact cars, but I thought we'd be safe renting a full-size. I know other cars were available (the lot was FULL of cars, but we were told they were either not technically 'full-size' or weren't 'ready to be rented') and feel like they basically reached into my pocket and stole a hundred dollar bill. \n\nThe location is a huge pain-in-the-@ss, too. Two shuttles or a $30 taxi. Wish I'd saved myself the hassle and gone with a more convenient, more reputable company. \n\nAvoid, avoid, avoid.",0
I finally found a bar in my neighborhood with a patio for smokers and now they are closed. RIP,0
"It is now time after a few visits to chat up the new Vig Uptown for a bit.  It is my belief that this concept, which I call for lack of a better phrase \""""the tavern concept\"""" is the all the rage in the Phoenix (surrounding) F & B scene.  To the credit of the vigsters they sort of started this wave.  I have heard so many times about new places, that are \""""Viglike\"""" or \""""A cross between the Vig and something else.\"""".  So kudos to the Vig for creating a new genre in our AZ scene. The question remains, How did they do at re-creating their own thing?\n\nAs is so often the case I wish I had a 1/2 star at my disposal.  I would like to go 31/2.   This is only because as nice as I have found The Vig to be 4 stars just sounds lofty to me for what they are.  Having said that, I choose to round up because they do what they do well and I do not want to knock them down to the blase 3.  \n\nThe Vig is definatley that good looking girl with nice style and a little edge, that you onlly hope that has a little substance.  The refurbed old bank has clean lines, a great mix and use of materials, a nice flow, and a nice airy feel.  The place is a perect balance of hip and sceney, yet comfortable and the kind of place you want to make a night of, yet a chill place to drop in and have a bite with shorts and flip-flops.  I do wish they would have paid a bit more homage to the bank that they used, but that is just a personal opinion.\n\nI don't know if it is expectation or what but I always expect the food to be a little better than it is.  The menu always has me torn between several enticing and well-described items, which always makes me excited.  The results are a resounding \""""fine\"""".   From the steak sandwich, to the wings, to the chocolate brownie for dessert, they have all been perfectly OK.  I keep going back and I won't stop but it is the atmosphere that drives me. The food somehow seems to lack flavor.  Even when that seems impossible, such as the carne asada over a potato pancake.  Howver, it is good enough to keep coming back.\n\nThe service can be a little slow and dis-interested, but I do find the friendliness and attitude to be better at this location, than the original.  \n\nSo in the end The Vig Uptown is that pretty girl with a lot of style that is nice to have on your arm.  Is she the best cook?  No, but she at least gives it a try.  Will she blow you away with deep conversation about the secrets of the world?  No, but she definatley has something to say.  Is she cool and nice and fun to hang out with?  Heck Yes, I think we will go out again.",1
The owner is a condescending unpleasant person who belittles his customers. The food has been on a steady decline for a number of years and is getting worse by the day.  stay far away from this money pit! unless you want to waste money on bad food and a horrible experience.,0
Jean-Marc's is definitely one of the best bakeries in Pittsburgh. I like to stop here after doing some record shopping. Their pastries are out of this world. The kouign aman and creme brulee are my favorites. The prices are great and the staff is very helpful. I've been to a couple of other French bakeries around the city and none of them compare.,1
Absolutely one of the best steaks in town.  Not a big fan of the sides that came with it but I ordered the 22oz. porterhouse and it was amazing.  Service was excellent!!  Waitress was very friendly and the food was delivered quick!  Maybe a little too quick lol.  I didn't get to finish my salad.  It's ok because it was mediocre like the rest of the sides.  The steak is why you're here though and well worth it!!,1
"All I wanted is some pie, and she wouldn't give it to me.....\n\nNo, seriously. I was the easiest and best type of customer a business just dreams about. I knew what I wanted, and I all wanted to do is paid for it and leave - simple.\n\nSo I went inside and I grabbed the apple pie and started to look for the pumpkin pie - couldn't find it. I finally located a worker...\""""I am off the clock\"""" he said and walked away. OK. I spotted another....\""""I will be right back\"""" she said and walked off, never to be seen again. I manage to find the pumpkin pie, but it was the behind the display case - the kind that employee reach in to retrieve the pies. I started to look around for help again, no one to be seen. By the way, this was sunday afternoon with several customers inside. I heard some workers in the back room and they saw me, but chose to ignore me. At that point I should have just left, but all I wanted is some damn pie. So I went around the counter, reached in for the pie, grabbed it, took it to the register, paid for it and left.\n\nWHY MAKE BUYING PIE SO DIFFICULT?\n\nAnyway, the pies were good, little pricey but good, not spectacular. Although it got me thinking. With the employees that care so little, how much love did go in to making that pie. Would they care if they dropped some filling on the floor. Would they pick that back up and put it back in the pie. I have never seen that a work ethic this bad. \nI hope that management gets their act together and actually manages their employees.",0
"Our worst meal experience ever.  The waitress couldn't get our order right to save her life, our drink order!  We ordered two lemonades, she drops off two ice waters, so we assume the lemonade is coming.  She comes back by a few times so we finally ask if they're coming, oh you wanted Lemonade?  How many?  I say two and hold up two fingers.  She comes back with one.  Okay fine, we'll share.  The appetizer wasn't very good or hot.  Then our food came, the buffalo chicken sandwich tasted good.  Then I take a bite of my mashed potatoes and they were ice cold in the center, like they had thawed out a frozen mound of potatoes.  We had to get up and leave, enough was enough!",0
Its just ok. They didn't return any of my phone calls. The people that work there are definitely not friendly. very small space. The teachers are very good.,0
"Hate it. Came here when I was younger and got food poisoning. Haven't came back for almost 15 years. However, I decided to give them a second chance last night. Albeit I didn't get food poisoning again, I found the food to be subpar - the service nonexistent - and the overall experience to be bleh. \n\nThe only thing going for this place is the king crab legs. Hordes of Asian tourists line up for this. I will admit that to get this here for the price of $25-30 buffet dinner is aiiiight. But other than that, this place has nothing else worth eating. Many of the items were cold and/or bland. \n\nSo surprising how the line is so unbelievably long for such unforgivingly nasty food. I pray I never have to return.",0
"I have been to Browns a handful of times, always wanting to give it another go based on a recommendation and always walking away wondering why I did.\n\nEvery time I have been here I have had food which is mediocre at best. It does a job but doesn't exactly do it well.  My most recent visit was no different - everything we ordered turned up greasy and on a bed of mayo. Did we choose poorly?  Definitely. But come on.  The fish cakes were about 95% potato and the sweet potato wedges were enormous slices of sweet potato which must have been boiled first as they were (mostly) cooked through but were soft instead of coming across as baked or fried, albeit covered with a layer of oil.  Very confusing and resulting in not a nice dish.  The chorizo sausage roll was dripping in oil (bad choice on our part but really poor menu choice on Browns part), which left is with only the Cesar salad which was fresh and well dressed.\n\nOn top of the food, the service was close to abysmal. Our server brought ice water when I asked for no ice (I know, and by itself it wouldn't matter but paired with the rest...), then never returned to refill our glasses when they were empty.  In fact, the next time we saw her after our food was deposited was when we hunted her down for the bill.  Even then she didn't clear our dishes and instead opted to do so once she brought our change and we were in the process of leaving, which felt weird and almost as though we were being guilted into leaving a greater tip. \n\nI think I've given Browns enough chances.  There are plenty of half decent places to get food on George St, no point in returning to one which can't even deliver the half.",0
"Forgot to review this place before. Been here multiple times (including just now to see Skyfall) with the never ending $5 Groupon. Basically you get a soda or iced tea + a ticket for $5. It's normally $7-$10 for a ticket and $3 for a soda so it's not a bad deal.\n\nYou can't buy your ticket online w/the Groupon, but the theater has recently switched to 100% reserved seating. You can check if the theater is full or not before you leave home by selecting a movie time on their website then getting to the reserved seating page and it'll show you how many seats have been purchased.\n\nThe food they serve is mostly stuff you can eat with your fingers. The prices seem high, but the portions are kinda big. Like none of it seems intended for one person to eat alone. The food itself is not really bad but not like mind numbingly good either. I've never had anything soggy or gross like some other reviewers had, and I've even been there for midnight showings.\n\nSo, the negatives.\n\nWith the new big releases, sometimes they take like a billion years to clean the theater out before the next showing. This is \""""normal\"""" at other theaters, yes, but at other theaters you have your snacks before you walk in the door. Here, it means you can't sit down and order something before the lights go out, which is often inconvenient for the other patrons. The servers try to be quiet, but it doesn't always work out that way. Also, like other reviews have noted, the office chairs suck, and the LED service lights can be annoying.\n\ntl;dr = Buy a few Groupons, sit in the love seats.",1

I met a friend here for brunch and it was absolutely delicious.  I highly recommend the Matador.  Things I would never have thought of to combine but it was absolutely delicious.  They also have a great bloody mary bar for only $5.  I would highly highly recommend this place. You can sit indoors or out.  They have misters so even in the heat it didn't feel that bad.  The servers were attentive but not in your face so we were able to sit and talk without feeling like we were being pushed out.  \n\nParking is difficult but they do have a free valet.,1
I am relatively new to Las Vegas. A friend of mine suggested Ritual. I signed up to receive a $20 off coupon as a new client. Conveniently their hair cuts are priced at $60 and the coupon is only on services $65+. I called and asked if they could honor the coupon and their suggestion was to add a $35 deep conditioner. Really? You can't charge me $5 more for a haircut so I can take advantage of the coupon? Clearly you do not want new business. I will not be using Ritual.,0
"Studio 360 is a gem to say the least and for quite a few reasons: student pricing, cycling shoes available for anyone who has yet to invest in their own pair, incredibly encouraging/talented/kind/inspiring instructors, phenomenal music, new bikes, and it's all in the dark which adds a whole new slew of pluses! Even though it's a group class, it in no way resembles others I've participated in. The darkness allows you to focus on your individual experience and forget about how much you're sweating, how red you've become and how much better others may be.  There's nothing like a spin class at Studio 360, an hour of physically strenuous cardio never flew by so quickly and felt so dang good! \nThis is active meditation; a totally elating, calorie-burning, cardiovascular adventure!",1
"I brought my sweet sister in law shopping at this Forever 21 location.  She had a bag full of goodies (several hundreds of dollars worth) from H&M.  She stopped at Forever 21 and  sat her bag on the ground right beside her while she tried on a pair of shoes.  Her H&M bag was stolen during that brief moment that the bag was not in her arms.....and while this certainly was not the responsibility of Forever 21....we were so disappointed in the way the Forever 21 staff reacted. They did not call security, or the police, or even offer any condolences.  They just shrugged their shoulders.  My sister in law did love some of the fashions at Forever 21....but the store was such a mess.  There were clothes all over the floor under each and every rack.  There were way too few staff members working, and many who were working were \""""socializing\"""" with one another instead of helping customers or maintaining the store inventory in a decent fashion. The only employees that were on task were:  1 at the checkout, and 1 at the fitting rooms - there was a band of 5 girls dressing one mannequin while the store was amidst in chaos (including someone stealing bags from other customers).....

"Visiting a Gordon Ramsey restaurant was to be a highlight of our Vegas trip for my teen, who enjoys his Master Chef shows.  We so wanted to like this restaurant...but it wasn't to be.  We thought the decor and iPad menus were neat, but the tight server uniforms rode up on the waitresses thighs to the point I worried we were going to see more than intended.  We started with the Truffle Fries, which were tough and tasted stale. Instead of being golden brown and crisp, they were pale and appeared to have been sitting a long time between frying.  When offered a replacement, we switched to the Maui Onion Rings and they truly were fabulous.  The worst part of the experience though was the burgers.  We ordered one Farm Burger and one Chanterelle Mushroom Burger, both well done.  Both came, sans any sauce, and severely under done...very pink inside. You would think a restaurant specializing in burgers is very experienced in cooking them to the customers desired done ness (otherwise why ask \""""how would you like that cooked?\"""").  We sent those back as well, and told the waitress to not rush, we'd rather have them done than fast.  When our replacement burgers arrived, one was fine but the other was pink on one side.  When it was returned as well (with no offer of selecting a different entree), we were so disappointed.  My teen ate her Farm Burger and just as we were ready to request the check (and go find another option for lunch for me since I was now starving), the on duty manager approached and comp't our meal.  This was nice (and the right thing to do), but I would have greatly preferred to speak to him much earlier and actually eat something for lunch, so having him not appear until that point was actually the coffin nail that labeled our experience an \""""epic fail\"""".",0
"Terrible wait time and service, thank you for ruining valentines day for us. Food is ok but the service sucks even with reservation. Go else where if you want a quality time. Never going back.",0
"While Benecol is clinically proven to lower your cholesterol, this place is clinically proven to raise it. I guarantee you'll enjoy eating at this place, but make sure you've sent off to China for your donor heart before hand, cuz you'll be needing a new one.\n\nOn my one and only visit I got a deep fried pizza which I chewed on in the company of two JF's. They, being PHD students, probably viewed me with utter contempt, and were only there with me to conduct a study into socially inept and underdeveloped human beings. As a result I ate with a reasonable degree of dignity in an effort not to draw too much attention to myself.\nHad I been dining alone, my behaviour would have been distinctly less muted, and I would have wrung the doughy treat out into my mouth like a tea towel saturated with pizza flavoured fat. Then with more enthusiasm than a Romanian prostitute who had just realised she could earn a Leu and get something warm in her belly at the same time, I would have sucked the oily dregs from its limp remains, and given thanks for the privilege.\n\nYUM-YUM.",1
"Bakers Nursery is where I've spent the majority of my weekend mornings.  I've either been pointed to a needed plant, or discovered it on my own.  Folks have always been helpful & informative.\n\nI will agree that they are pricey but big box stores cannot compare to the inventory at Bakers. Moreover, I'm do not agree with Yelp colleagues' low reviews. Unfortunately, gardening is 'at risk'. You figure out what your soil & attention span will foster and you are successful with those plants. Indeed, gardening comes with a learning curve that comes with failures & successes.\n\nTheir niche in the neighborhood will be a chasm after December.",1
"This buffet is hit or miss and it figures that the time I decide to review it, the place had a very off day, including giving me a mild case of food poisoning again. Usually, the fried chicken, if available, is the top attraction, due to its crispyness and moist meat. On this day, which was a Monday afternoon, I had rotiserre chicken breast which was the best offering. Nothing else actually looked or tasted good. Mole chicken sounded great and on my initial walkthrough, that is why I purchased the buffet. Too bad, that this mole had no relation to real Mexican mole and the entire dish was too dryed out. Stffed cabbage was a horror show and the taco meat section was one giant pool of grease. Mongolian BBQ was also tried, but they don't put any sauce on it when they cook it, so it tastes just like, well nothing. The Chile Relleno was possibly the worst looking thing ever and didn't taste much better either. Deserts needed some work as well, but the butter pecan custard (they said it was) was decent, although could have been the culprit also to my later problems. You know what bothered me also was that there is a Guy cooking back there and anytimne anybody spills something (like some corn, etc) he is all over it, taking his nasty over the shoulder towel and dabbing it up. I'm all for a clean buffet, but find something else to do for a few minutes besides clean up every piece of corn that falls out of a laddling spoon. Maybe think of a better recipe to have us eat. Call ahead and if the fried  chicken is available for dinner, it is worth the $8.99 itself with a few side dishes that are usually better than this lunch, which would include potatoes. Oh, the rice was excellent.",0
"Worse food ever!!  My family went here for lunch for the first time and it will be the last time.  We had never tasted anything like before.  We got the com, pho, bun thit nuong, che, and it tasted really bad.",0
"Great place to have a relaxing dinner and enjoy a glass of wine. The outdoor seating is nice, if you don't want to sit in the loud and dark lounge inside. \n\nTheir service is great. We loved their sushi and sashimi, yuummmm. Empanadas, Seared scallops and Pan roasted Chicken were scrumptious.",1
"So cute inside! Good service, the cupcakes were not dry and very pretty. The frosting was a little too sweet for my taste, but yummy all the same. \n\nTry the peanut butter cookies! They were delicious! Me and the hubby will definitely stop in again and try something on one of our cheat days!",1
"i have been going here since i was a kid and i have always loved it! On my last visit i got a slice of pepperoni pizza, there slices are ENORMOUS!! There pizza is a little on the greasy side but that's the way i like it",1
"Cowaaaaaaaaaaaabunga!\n\nMe:  Can I spin? \nStaff: No.\nMe:  Can I run and leap off?\nStaff: No. \nMe:  Can you at least push me with all your might?  \nStaff:  Okay.\nMe:  woohoo! \nHe only touched my back.  Argh.\n\nDespite being denied all my requests, I still enjoyed the ride.  \n\n1.  Light as a Feather. Light as a feather.\nAs soon as you enter you will get weighed for the world to see.  At least it's not posted up.  When I went skydiving they posted your weight along side your name.  \n\nThe maximum weight is 250 lbs.\nThe minimum is 60lbs.\n\nMy 8 year old wanted to go but he was too light.  \n\n2.  Bring an ID.  \nEven though your showing Grey hairs you ain't gonna get the pass and go without your ID\n.  Shouldn't you have it all times in Vegas?  They'll let you gamble but once you hit that jack pot.  They ask for your ID in order to walk out with your winnings.\n\n3.  Sign your life away here ______.\nYou have to fill out the paper work and pay before you go up.  For skydiving you pay when you set foot on ground. \n\n4.  Leave your belongings.\nIf someone in your group is going to be a spectator on the bottom.  Give them your things.  They provide a small bag to carry your things.  The lightest person in your group gets the bag.  \n-no sunglasses - no cameras- no phones - nothing in your hands - even your flip flops must go in the bag\n\nThey allow you to use your own camera or phone to take pictures while your in line.  But you have to put away all loose objects once you hit the zip line.  \n\n5.  Let's get personal.\nThey strap you on to a harness. I saw a handful of girls with dresses and skirts but they had that who cares were in Vegas mentality.  Boys, they get close to your swimmers of life.  \n\n6.  Say Cheese : D\nThere are photographers to take pictures near the end.  Ask the staff where there located, so your picture ready.  \n\nGo with a group so you can relive the experience.  I went with my dad and my husband. If you know someone scared of heights persuade them to go.  Their jitters makes it more thrilling for you. Another person in line was pacing back and forth and spewing out profanities to his friend for getting him up there. \n\n I had the Las Vegas Power Pass, this came with the deal.   The catch for the pass is that you can only ride before 6pm.  I watched people zoom across at night and it definitely seemed cooler.  We were quoted 30 minutes and we waited around that time.  I'm sure at night it's much longer.  \n\nCost:\n$15 before 6 pm\n $20 after 6 pm\nGo again same day for $5\n\nTo me this is worth the try.  But if your a lone ranger, the wait may be too long, and the thrill too short lived.",1
Best Burger Joint ever.  That.  Is. All.,1
"Went here with a few friends a few Saturday nights ago, and we had a good time. I'll agree with Jessica that this bar is very un-Pittsburgh; I now reside in Chicago, and Brillobox feels a lot more like a bar you would find in Wicker Park than in the hills of the 'Burgh. Beer was pretty cheap and their appetizers (we had the nachos; a friend had the bean dip) were out of this world.\n\nAfter an hour we went upstairs to the dance floor and I was kind of disappointed; apparently depending on the DJ they play either sweet indie rock or a lot of electronica, and we were there on an electronica night. Still, major props for playing a Madonna remix. I got my dance on.",1
"We ate here twice in the past week while we were in Phoenix (same location).  The wings are great (get the crispy version (bone-in) with whatever flavor.  Pizza and salads are also very good.\n\nEnough about the food.  The first night we met some friends and were about a half hour late so they had already ordered so we dismissed the poor service.  We didn't have silverware and when my wife asked, the waiter asked if a plastic fork was ok.  She had a salad and wings.  I looked up and asked U Wot M8?  \""""Are you serious?\""""  He just stared at me and said he would go get one but they were dirty.  I said we don't want a dirty fork and he just left. He came back with not one, but three sets of perfectly good silverware wrapped in napkins and they were clean. Needless to say, the waiter was dreadful and I had a hard time tipping him anything but I mustered a small one.\n\nThe second night we came back and the place was dead, maybe at 20% capacity but the lounge seemed busy (on the other side).  We even prefaced our meal and told our waitress about the horrible service the night before thinking she would get the hint.  She didn't.  Our food took forever, even if the bar was crowded.  She was not attentive to our drinks and, again, I had a hard time justifying a tip.\n\nBottom-line:  Go for the food because it IS good but don't expect anything beyond that.  They must train the staff to give horrible service on purpose.  I don't know how else to justify what we experience on two different nights with a small crowd.",0
"Pretty surprising for a sports bar. Excellent variety, higher end quality and consistency with everything we've tried here! Even their steamed veggies are amazing. Try their honey medium spicy wings! Bomb! Great service and drinks.",1
"I looooove Jason's Deli.  I would have to say it's one of the best Deli's I have ever been to.... Ever!  I order from there all the time and never get sick of it. They have a huge menu, which typically will make me leery of a place, because really, who can perfect that many items?.... Jason's!  All their food is made fresh to order, and they will modify anything on the menu to meet your needs.  Their online ordering system is easy to use and allows you to save your favorite orders.   They also have a great salad bar and their soups are fantastic.  My favorite is their vegetarian French onion soup, served in a bowl with boiling hot provolone cheese,  yum!  You will leave stuffed to the max or with leftovers, but don't forget to grab a complimentary ice cream cone on your way out.",1
"I know this place is new so I will give them another chance but I have been twice and had not great service.  The first time we went for dinner and received our meals before our starters and the waiter did not even realize we never received them.  He did take one off the bill which was nice.  They then charged by boyfriends card double which took about a week to get the charges reversed.  \n\nMy second visit was for lunch with a group of girlfriends and the experience was worse.  We all received our food at different times and the lost my order and one other girls order.  They did not even serve our soups at the same time, when we asked why they waitress said they were washing more bowl.  We found this very odd being that it was a weekday lunch with about 10 people in the entire place.  \n\nThe food was good.  The tuna lunch bowl was really good.  Be careful if you don't like spicy because the food is spicy.  For me thats a good thing.  I love close and I am excited about the place so I hope they get the kinks worked out.  The dumplings were Yum! \n\nHappy Eating!",0
"I was astounded by the service and the food at this joint. Honestly, for $150 per person including wine/cocktails/private dining room/tour of the kitchen/all the food we could eat in Vegas - are you kidding me? That's a steal. I don't remember one person at the table having a complaint. Hat's off to this place - world-class food and outstanding service with no attitude.",1
"BEWARE!! He's a SALESMAN, NOT AN ETHICAL DENTIST. By far the WORST dentist I have ever been to. Even though he knew I worked at a dental school, and know A LOT more than an average patient about dentistry, he still proceeded to \""""diagnose\"""" $5300 worth of treatment for fillings, crowns, etc. I had my x-rays looked at my 5 dentists at work in the next week. I didnt have a single cavity. I only actually needed 1 filling. If you want to go to someone who will tell you that you need restorations on every tooth, he's your man. Also, the hygienist did not display proper infection control technique. Who knows what bacteria/disease may be in that office.",0
"We stayed at the Luxor for 5 days, 4 nights in December. While reading other reviews I was a tad worried that our rooms would be awful.  Other then that I had no major worries. Check-in process was insane. There were so many people trying to check-in and out that you could not tell which line went where. Also there were many Luxor employees \""""hanging\"""" around the registration area that did nothing to let guest know where to go. Once we found the line it was not that bad of a wait because they opened up more check-in stations.\n\nWe were in the Pyramid and were told how to get to our room which was pretty easy. My only complaint was that it was on the other side of the casino but that is nothing major. I was pleasantly surprised when I entered our room to see modern and updated furniture as well as a brand new TV. My only concern with where the room was that we would hear a lot of noise from the casino below but we heard nothing our entire stay.\n\nAs for the casino it is just like all the others I have ever been too. My biggest complaint of all the casino is Vegas are that they allow smoking which is disgusting and make it unbearable to gamble in the evenings. During the day and early afternoon I was fine but once the early evening and late night hit I could not stand to be anywhere near a casino.\n\nFood was rather lacking in my opinion but they do offer an array of fast food and casual dining plus two Starbucks. It was not that big of a deal to us because we went to Mandalay Bay and New York, New York for dinner the entire trip and that was connected by walkways. I just wish they had a few more options for breakfast other then Mcdonalds, Starbucks, and the Pyramid Cafe.\n\nThere were about three shops in the Luxor so just go next door to Mandalay or down to City Center or Planet Hollywood to get your shopping fix. As for entertainment the Luxor has Criss Angel's Believe, Carrot Top, Fantasy, and Menopause the Musical. We saw Criss Angel and I was not impressed. Compared to the other hotels on the strip Luxor needs to think about getting some more or different shows. We did not try any of the bars or lounges at Luxor as we went elsewhere since most were closed on Monday and Tuesdays.\n\nCheck-out was a breeze since we put the daily resort fee on a credit card. We just used the express check-out located by the bank of elevators or the main desk to return our keys which avoided the long check-out line.\n\nOverall this was a great hotel and even better deal for six people. I would not hesitate to stay again.",1

"as a kid, i remember going to sbarro in the malls back in illinois. even as a teenager, we would still hit up sbarro. i remember the pizza being huge slices of super thin, delicious, greasy pizza.\n\ni dont know what happened. the gf and i were at fashion square and i thought i could relive my youth.\n\ni could not have been more wrong. talk about garbage pizza. i had a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni. the pizza tasted and looked like it was just a reheated, frozen pizza. the crust sucked, the slice was small with a thicker crust, the sauce tasted like sweet artificiality. and not \""""sweet\"""" as in \""""good,\"""" \""""sweet\"""" as in too much sugar.\"""" and the cheese congealed in about 30 secs to a weird, fake cheese consistency.\n\nthey also had other italian entrees sitting in the trays, but these looked like they had been sitting in the same spot since the mall opened that morning.\n\nthe gf made fun of me when i said i was going to yelp the sbarros at the mall . . . but i want to save anyone else from having their teenage mall memories drowned in gross tomato sauce and crappy crust.",0
"I came here on a first date. Thank God for the bacon board, it made the whole experience bearable! I would definitely get that again. \nThe whole atmosphere is adorable and I would definitely sit at the bar next time. Thank you for the awesome food that made up for the lousy company!",1
"The food is really good, particularly the fried chicken (their signature dish).  I also love their side dishes.  I tried the porkchop once as well, which was great!  \n\nMy only issue is their service is really inconsistent.  I have been here three times.  Of the three, I had adequate service once.  The other two times, the servers were slow--not checking back to see how our food was, not refilling drinks, etc.  Last time, our server was outright rude.  She made several mistakes (forgot our appetizer, cornbread, did not refill water) and only offered a half-hearted apology.  She rolled her eyes at my husband.  Just totally uncalled for.  Honestly, I love their food, but I probably won't go back here when there are so many other options in Charlotte.  They really need to invest in some server training.  Also, it would help to have a manager out walking the floor.  I have never seen a manager here, and would definitely have welcomed the chance to give feedback in person rather than on Yelp.  I really wanted to like this place, but I don't because of the poor service.",0
"This is an update to the reviews that I have posted....\n\nI'm disappointed by some of the feedback posted about The Liberty. Either my standards are low or I have consistently been lucky.

My friend had the crab-cake eggs Benedict and was equally impressed.\n\nI have moved homes and sadly can't get to The Liberty more often.",1
Its amazing! little place best cheesesteaks! you have to try it!,1

"Extremely overpriced, mediocre Italian food; no atmosphere of any kind (other than strip mall kind) - but service at least is fast so you don't suffer too long.  Best thing that can be said is that it's close to the exits from Caesar's ... so you can get out quickly.",0
Soooooo delicious. So glad I found this place. Hard to find a real sushi and Japanese grill. Yummmm,1
I bought a groupon for a facial and I made my appointment and took the day off from work. I showed up 15 minutes early only to be told that my appointment is at their Jones location. If you have the henderson address on groupon and yelp and only 1 phone number to call then how are we to know they have a second office? What a waste of my time and money. I'm going to try to get my money back from groupon since this was such a horrible experience. This place seems to have a really bad scheduling issue and it was a pain for me to even get an appointment. The lady at the desk at the office only said that she was sorry and there was nothing that she could do. I was really looking forward to it too. I do have to say that the office did seem to look pretty nice- Too bad I didn't get to have my facial and I wasted a vacation day.,0
"Very very good, expensive, but worth it. We ordered the small tasting menu. Perfect if you want a little taste of a bunch of different stuff. Waiter wasn't that friendly, but he did a very good job as far as service is concerned.",1
"I have been shopping at Target stores for many many years now, and this is by far the worst location I've ever had the displeasure of visiting!\n\nI usually only shop at the Target close to my house off of Flamingo and Grand Canyon.  But I was shopping there for a certain piece of workout gear and they didn't have my size in stock.  So I called this location and after getting juggled between multiple employees over a 10 minute period I finally got someone to confirm that they not only had my size, but they had plenty of them.  So I decided to make the 10 or so minute drive up to get the item.\n\nUpon arriving, I walk into what I would call one dirty, horribly unorganized store.  It looked like the carpet hadn't been vacuumed in a long ass time.  There are clothes just laying on the dirty floor off of the racks.  I am already not impressed with this place and it's only been 30 seconds.  I start walking to where I'm assuming the men's clothing section is.  I do a full circle and still haven't found it.  I finally see an employee and ask them where it is and they point behind a wall that I was figuring was the back of the store, but it's actually just some stupid divider.  \n\nI scan all the racks twice and not only do I not see my size that was promised was here, but they don't even have the item stocked.  Not even one ugly color in the wrong size.  They don't have shit!  So I track down another employee which took about 10 minutes and tell them that I called and was assured the item was here.  They look with me for a minute or so and say \""""Yeah, guess not\"""" and walk away.  \n\nSo needless to say this was a wasted trip!  A waste of gas and a waste of about an hour of my time.\n\nSo while I'm still a fan of Target in general...fuck this location!",0
"This restaurant is poorly managed and the food is a little below average. However I proceeded to try them again since they offered delivery. \nI called in a order for Habachi steak, they said I needed to order more than $15 so I added rice noodles with shrimp. They said that wasn't enough so I ordered generals chicken as well. The order was placed at 7:20 arrived at 8:30 with no Habachi Steak. The manager said we didn't charge you for the steak but if you want it I can charge your credit card another $13 and deliver it to you. I said come and pick up the food you delivered and bring me the Habachi steak and just charge me $15. She said we can't do that, no we have to charge you again.   So instead of paying $20 for a meal they're requesting I pay $33 total.  That was the last time I'll ever order from them again. They're several other Asian restaurants in the area with better service and better food. This was that time when i knew exactly what i wanted to eat and didn't get it.",0
"Don't give this place your business!!! Buying my wedding dress was supposed to be a special & memorable experience. Instead, I was treated like crap, ignored, and even hung up on by the owner!! My dress came in missing accessories, and when I asked when I can expect the missing pieces to be delivered, he gave me a deep sigh, rolled his eyes, and said \""""I'll let you know!\""""  All in all, the entire experience was a nightmare, and the staff was rude & extremely unprofessional. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.",0
"I brought my old ford taurus to change or fix the steering pump and left the car with Sun overnight. I was very specific saying, I need to fix the pump before I sell the car. They said, we understand. Next day I came, they gave me an estimate $1959! This is for a $1000 car! In the estimate, they offered to change each and every steering part. As a result, I had to drive the car without the pump back home and you know how hard it is.",0
"I thought the hot dog was good, but not $6 good. It would have been nice to have had a choice of a regular bun instead of the flat bread. \n\nI am not sure why everyone is raving over this food truck. There are better alternatives for hot dogs in this city, especially if you are downtown.",0

"I don't know how to rate this.  The kid side of me wants to put 4 stars, but the adult side says 1.5/2.\n\nKid opinion: The big snake hanging down in the gift shop is cool.  The rain falling down and the fake thunderstorms and sparkling stars and atmosphere is neat.  And the desert with sparklers is awesome!\n\nAdult side: The food is blah.  The alcoholic beverages were boring or too sweet.\n\nBoth: Customer service was good.",0
"Came in this morning for their $10 brunch and beer special and was not disappointed. My wife and I sat on the patio and enjoyed a delicious OHSO hefeweizen, a cool and sweet mimosa, the steak and eggs burrito with guacamole and the lox and bagels.\n\nThe service was great, it seemed our waiter was always nearby to refill our drinks on the warm patio. Not long after we got there, they turned on the misters, which made the experience much more enjoyable. The food was delicious; the burrito was simple and savory, and my wife loved the lox (you build your own sandwich, which she likes better). For everything we got, $10/plate with beer is a fantastic deal!\n\nI think the thing I like most about this place was the atmosphere. Every member of the staff were friendly, even bringing out water and snacks to the canine customers. The local beer selection is one of the best I've seen.\n\nI highly recommend this place, we may be making OHSO a staple for our weekend brunches to come.",1
"Indian Mela definitely seem to be one of the forgotten Indian restaurants of Edinburgh. This is undeserved. Located on the competitive South Clerk St. Indian Mela should be one of your Indian regulars.\n\nThe menu is pretty extensive, which isn't always a good thing as it can mean a lot of unfresh, pre-prepared dishes. However everything I've tried at Indian Mela has been good quality. As well as a lot of classic dishes you will find in other British Indian restaurant, there is a decent selection of specialities and in particular a good vegetarian selection. I recommend the Sag Panir!\n\nPrices do range, but expect to pay between \u00a37 and \u00a310 for a main meal. Portions are decent. The staff are also friendly and at times quite chatty.\n\nA great little Indian restaurant that deserves to be better known.",1
"My husband and I hadn't gone there in many years - no idea why, but we always seem to end up in Arrowhead restaurant row,  fighting traffic and long waits (unless we're at Cheesecake Factory which always seems to have ample tables). It was our anniversary and we decided to try a different restaurant.\n\nWe were glad we went!  On a Friday night we only had to wait about 20 minutes, which we did at the bar - just enough time to have a drink.  The drink prices are really good and the bartender got our drink order as soon as we sat down, even though the entire bar was full (we got the last 2 seats).\n\nAbout 10 minutes after arriving, the hostess found us in the bar and asked us if we wanted a table (she could seat us then) or if we wanted to wait for a booth (we did) - instead of just dragging us to a table.  We should have requested a booth when we arrived, and forgot, so it was nice that they asked before we vacated our seats at the bar.\n\nThe food arrived in a timely manner and was terrific - great steak and lobster and, again, great prices.  We really like the fact that you can order your steak to size according to your hunger: no reason for over eating unless you want to.  The veges were cooked just right - not too crisp nor too limp. The portions were all good sized except for my baked potato.  It wasn't as large as other restaurants, but maybe that's why I had room for dessert (usually don't). \n\nFor dessert we got the sampler, figuring it would be 3 small portions. Wrong!  They were all full-size as far as I'm concerned.  We both looked at it and said, \""""how are we going to eat all this?\"""" (we did lol). My husband liked the carrot cake & cheesecake, and I loved the pecan fudge brownie with ice cream/whipped cream/hot fudge.\n\nLast but not least, our server was full of personality - we really liked her and tipped her accordingly...\n\nAll in all, a great night! We won't let so much time go by before visiting again.",1
"I'm a big fan of babystacks' pancakes. I think the hazelnut pancakes, with plenty of strawberries and whipped cream, are generally outstanding. The service here is A+ as well, keeping coffee and water cups full at nearly all times. At this point, you might be wondering: from whence did this four star review come? First, I'd rather give a 4.5 star review. Second, I admit that I've been spoiled by some outstanding breakfasts in my lifetime. Also, I can't order sweet breakfast every time I go out. My only knock on this place is that their savory breakfasts, while still very very good, don't knock my socks off. Again, I haven't had a bad experience here, and I doubt I ever will. Enjoy your delicious food and great service.",1
"If there was a 0 that's what it would be. THIS PLACE WILL RIP YOU OFF.

"Checked out the Mellow Mushroom last night... I am still kicking myself for not visiting this place sooner!  The places along Selwyn have been sprouting up left and right so the area is pretty nice to spend an evening in.  Never-the-less, I was super hungry when I parked and ventured in with a friend.  It was a Tuesday night so there were a ton of tables available (none in the bus though :(  oh well).  Tuesday nights is apparently trivia night so we walked in halfway through the 2nd round of questions.  It was actually kind of fun racking our brains for the answers (while we were waiting on our food) but not really playing at the same time.\n\nI ordered the 10\"""" Kosmic Karma... man was it good.  All the pizza is baked to order so it may be a wait for the food - SO WORTH IT THOUGH.  To entertain you, you could probably order an appetizer or sample their extensive beer selection.\n\nThe staff seemed to be a mixture of people and very laid back.... don't expect quick service here, but I guess the lackadaisical service adds to the mood of the place.  I didn't really mind it too much.\n\nThe only downside I did take note of was the noise level of the restaurant... granted there was trivia going on so there wasn't any music playing but maybe it was a combo of the HVAC, the kitchen, and all the conversations around us....",1

"By far my best dining experience in Vegas, actually in a while. They definitely deserve all 5 stars for the service, food, appearance and everything.\n\nService:\nWe came here without reservations and were told we had an 1 and 30 minute wait so we figured we would walk around and catch the Fountains at Bellagio show. The hostess then told us to come back after 30 minutes and she would give us a buzzer. We see the show and come back only to have to wait for just 3 minutes. We asked them to sit us on the balcony and with only a side balcony table being opened they let us wait for the center table to to be cleaned without any issue! Our waitress had a very cheery attitude and recommended us dishes to try.\n\nFood:\nWe started of with Duck confit and spinach with cranberries on the side and OMGoodness it was to die for! Like seriously the duck melted in my mouth! I ordered the steak with the caramelized onions and hand carved french fries and my bf had the seafood special. The food was well cooked and very filling.\n\nI highly recommend Mon Ami Gabi for a nice dinner and will be back for more duck confit!",1
"I've been coming to this restaurant since 2008- I can say I've never had a bad experience or meal. The food has always been consistently delicious, warm, and savory. My nana was Cuban and the food here brings it pretty close to her home cooked meals. The service has always been friendly and the restaurant well kept with a very inviting decor. I've recommended and brought many friends and relatives here and they have all agreed that compared to Versailles or other Cuban restaurants we have been too this is by far the Best. \n\nEven my Cuban friends have loved the experience and food here. Today I was back in Vegas and as is usual for me I went in for lunch with a friend who had never had Cuban food. She LOVED IT! The croquetas were delicious, as was my Picadillo (as usual) and the Salmon was exquisite. \n\nWhen we finished our meal we asked we could we go to catch a cab back to the Treasure Island, the waitress offered to call for one. After waiting no more than 5 minutes the owner Sergio- came out to try to flag one down. Since no one was stopping he then went back into the restaurant, grabbed his keys and told us: \""""follow me ladies I will drive you.\"""" NOW THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE! \n\nThank you Sergio for your kindly driving us back to our hotel. We will definitely remain loyal patrons of your restaurant! Love, Angelica & DeeDee",1
"I am a monthly covered parker at this location.  The rates are quite high ($80/month) but being that I'm on the road 6 days a week sometimes (I'm a flight attendant) its the best deal of any place around.  The drivers are always quite friendly and will pick you up and drop you off right at your car.   The shuttles are usually right there to pick you up on your way into the airport, though they are a little slower going back to your car.  (though going to catch your flight is really when you need punctuality so it's no big deal.)\n\nNot sure how the daily rates work, but as often as I travel, this place is the best around.",1
"Here's the thing... shortly after being seated the waitress spilled an entire pint glass of water DIRECTLY in my lap.  She was extremely embarassed and very apologetic, and I was good natured about the incident because after all, it was just water.  However, what bothered me was the fact that no manager or lead came to the table to apologize or at least buy me a beer.  There are three people at my table cleaning up ice and water, and an hour later I leave your restaurant STILL wet and you can't take a moment to address the situation? It left a bad taste in my mouth.  In addititon, the happy hour menu is rather limited and the sushi isn't bad, but not memorable either.  I'd much rather do happy hour at Ra or some other more consistant establishment.",0

Go forth and drink fruity island drinks, people!",0
"There are few things I can justify waiting in line for in Vegas. Good food is one of them. After a 45 minute wait in line, we definitely built up a big appetite. I was excited to try the Wynn buffet, especially after running into our friends who were on their way back from the Wynn. They managed to wake up at 9am on Sunday to head over there for brunch. I'm sorry, but I need at least 5 hours of sleep! One of the girls was eating a shiny red candied apple that looked so good. I couldn't believe she got it from the buffet. The Bellagio buffet didn't offer candied apples!\n\nWhile waiting in line, cocktail waitresses actually came around with little bottles of water, which was greatly appreciated. It helped ease my growling stomach. This time, we decided to do the $30 regular brunch instead of the champagne or Bloody Mary brunch although it was only a few dollars more. \n\nThe atrium was nicely lit but the only tables available for two was right by the entrance, so we decided to sit in the main dining area. The nice thing about this buffet was that each area had a sign above it, so it was easy to locate everything. Because when you're hungry and know what you want, you don't want to go around looking for it. \n\nI was really happy with the variety, including the Asian food selections, and the carving station had bacon as well as prime rib. My favorite, of course, was the dessert station which included a variety of homemade ice cream flavors and toppings. The chocolate chip bread pudding was amazing straight out of the oven. All other desserts were ok.\n\nI was really impressed by our server, who was really attentive. Our friends had recommended that we have their hot chocolate, so I made sure to get a cup. It was so good, especially topped with whipped cream. \n\nThe couple who we sat next to also raved about the Wynn buffet, telling us that they made it a point to dine there every time they were in town. They said their dinner buffet was better though, just as most buffets are. \n\nWe walked out of there with Wynn buffet babies - we were so stuffed!",1
"I don't live in Phoenix, but I was planning a surprise baby shower IN Phoenix, so I turned to Yelp to find the best-tasting cakes in the area. Barb had the highest reviews, so I placed an order for a custom cake. Total cost was about $70 (which I was to pay when I picked up). We ordered a 1/2 sheet cake (chocolate) with strawberry filling and butter cream frosting. We had this special detail (a baby blanket) on top which cost an extra $20, but judging by the picture would be well worth it because it looked so cute.\n\nWhen I went to pick it up, I asked for a red velvet cupcake because I had read they had the best red velvet cupcakes anywhere. \n\nThe only reason I'm rating 4 stars instead of 5 is because of that cupcake -- it wasn't fresh or moist. The icing was delicious, but I didn't love the cupcake. \n\nBut the cake for the shower -- O. M. G. People were going absolutely nuts over this cake. It was hands-down, the BEST cake I've ever eaten at ANY kind of party or celebration, EVER. Moist, fresh, tasty, gorgeous, delicious. Five stars for that cake, for sure. \n\nSo I would definitely custom-order a fresh cake and not pick a cupcake out of the case. :-) The people there were all VERY helpful and friendly - the guy even carried the cake out to my car.",1
Food is good service is ok until I got the bill which was 102.00 which I gladly handed over my debit card and was told we need to run you driver license also because you spent over 100.00.

"It's great if you are under 30, over 30 find another locale.\n\nBy the way if you are over 30 in Madison are there any options?  Yes, there are, leave and find another larger fabulous city.\n\nMy recommendation is to be invisible or go somewhere else.",0
Just alright.  Had this baked potato with some of their BBQ brisket on top.  It was OK.,0
"I haven't been to many pubs, so I don't feel like I can give this a full 5. But, came here last week based on the recommendation of a friend who studied abroad a year ago.  Went up to order my fajitas and a burger and the bartender asked if we were students, I said I am... and he asked to see my student ID and BAM! 2-for-1 deal on our meals! so we got our food for 7.50 pounds! what?! hahaha i love unexpected deals. that alone bumped their rating to a 3,  but the extra star comes from how good the food was for the value! They give such a big portion of fajitas and only 4 torillas?! hahaha sad. you can ask for extra though i suppose... but really, fajitas were yummy! the burger was ok. their meat tastes different compared to meat here in the US, but it's a good thing according to my friends who ate it.\n\nI must mention that we came here on a Wednesday at 2pm, so it wasn't crowded at all.  The place was clean and staff polite! If I was in Edinburgh, I'd definitely come back here!!! Love it!",1

"Went to Beauregard on a Saturday night as they were featuring a crawfish boil for $15. It was a great deal with crawfish, sausage, shrimp, potatoes, shrooms and corn all in the pot, and all you can eat. \n\nGood traditional Nawlins flavors and spice, washed down with an Abita Turbo Dog. \n\nTheir menu is a bit limited and is a blend of Cajun and Southern. The best bet appears to be their daily specials, from Red Beans and Rice on Mondays to short ribs on Saturdays.",1
"The food at Pizzeria Bianco was okay, but I was actually thoroughly disappointed in my experience. It may have been that it had been built up for me for a long time, but the wait was long, the food wasn't the greatest, and the place itself was a bit cramped.\n\n1. Wait-time: Before I actually had my first dining experience there, I had tried 4 times previously to eat at Pizzeria Bianco. They don't take reservations, and the line is always out the door (or at least with 4-5 other groups ahead of you). On the day I actually had enough time to wait, I waited around 30 minutes to get seated, and another 10 or so for a waiter, and another 20 after that for the food to come out, for about an hour of total waiting time. \n**One good thing about the wait was that they had another building for you to sit and order appetizers/drinks if you wanted before you got seated.\n\n2. Food: I don't quite understand the hype of this pizza. The crust was burnt and the toppings were not the best either- I tried three types of pizza, sharing it with the friends I was with, but honestly, none of them struck me as absolutely amazing. \n\n3. Small room: I would estimate that there are about 8 tables at the place. Even after waiting for so long, we were stuck at the farthest corner of the restaurant by the restroom, and even that table was severely cramped. One of my friends was squished into the corner while another was awkwardly eating off of a side. \n\nI don't regret this experience at all- I have to say it was worth trying, just because it was rated the \""""Best Pizza in the US\"""" by various celebrity/food critic sources. I just personally wouldn't claim it as the best pizza I've ever had.",0
"XS would have been perfect in my book if they played better music.

Large dance floor leads to the outdoor patio that leads to the pool and more bars. Basically just the fabulous place you want to be at but it's not too packed that you feel like a sardine in a can!",1

"My girlfriend had 2 skirts altered by this place. Both for work purposes. The reason I am posting about this and not her is because I was the one who had to go pick it up and pay for it. \n\nI was amazed at how much it had cost for two business style skirts to get altered. They  had both sides taken in ( to make smaller). $36 a skirt for a grand total of $72. I came with $45 thinking that would cover the \""""cash only\"""" rule that still exists in today's world. So then I had to leave, go to an ATM then back to the place. Thinking the whole time, \""""Might as well go buy her a new skirt,\"""" but I have no fashion and she needed them!  So two weeks later and $72 in the hole we have skirts that fit. \n\nIs it great work yes. The people were really nice. If I needed it done over night I would probably pay that price. Inflating prices because of slow business.\n\nBusiness denied",0
"Good selection; good prices...........CREEPY! This place has no EMPLOYEES! Plus, everything was wrapped in cellophane - it might be easy- but it's not fresh!

Safeway has a growing Organics section & their Organics just won a national industry award! Whoo hoo!",0
"I have yet to find a nail salon in the South Hills area of Pittsburgh that's even close to the WORST nail salon I visited in southern California.  I keep hoping.  I've tried three and I'll keep trying.\n\nEnvy Nail Spa was clean.  They also accept credit cards, though they follow what seems to be the norm here in the Pgh area - they only accept cash tips - crazy.\n\nOther than that, I was completely unimpressed.  My nails look worse than they did when I went in and I did need a fill pretty badly.  My feet look great.  The massage with the pedicure was short and not very good, but my toes look wonderful.  If you just want a pedicure, this might not be a bad option.\n\nMy fingers, on the other hand... *shudder*  Most of them are filed so crooked that even my mom (with very poor eyesight) can tell they're crooked.  They're also SUPER SHORT.  She asked if I wanted them trimmed.  I said, \""""Yes, a little\"""" - next thing I knew, I barely had nails.  She claimed that it's because I have long nail beds (I do) and she kept thinking my nails were longer... but... I've had long nail beds my whole life and this is the ONLY time it's been a problem.  I was also just getting a pink fill, since there was plenty of white left on my nails (I normally get the white redone every other time), but now my nails look ridiculous, since she cut them so short.  I highly recommend that you avoid this for finger nails.  Most are crooked and all are WAY too short.",0

"I love mom & pop places. Zaw's is the best! I live close so I always get there before my food is done just to watch them cook. The kitchen does look dingy but I'm willing to overlook that because the food is so fantastic. The gentleman behind the burner is so quick and knows the recipes by heart, the son (I'm assuming) takes care of the orders and register and he is extremely kind. Everything is made to order even the hot & sour soup (which is the best I've ever had, seriously). I like to try new things each time I order but I'm stuck on the coconut curry tofu. Forget LuLu's, Howe Lee, New Dumpling House, and all of the other Chinese places, go to Zaw's instead.",1
"This place was just delightful.  I have been here twice now and liked it both times.  To be honest, I can't remember what apps I've had there, but I do remember the turkey bolognese and it was excellent.

"My wife and I had an absolute blast driving Ferrari F430GTs (not to be confused with their tamer, street-legal kin) with Dream Racing this weekend.  As a professional travel writer I have visited many vehicular \""""experiences\"""" around the world, and Dream Racing ranks among the most memorable.  \n\nThe Dream Racing facility is amazingly substantial and comprehensive, including 12 of these  jaw-dropping $250,000 supercars; a video theater; and multiple simulators programmed for the actual Las Vegas Motor Speedway track you drive on.  A stylish race suit and helmet (with built-in headset to communicate with your instructor) are provided.  The instructors (who ride with you our on the track) are spot-on with their psychology and ultra-encouraging - not to mention brave!  Driving the F430GT is unforgettable - and you'll never looking at motor racing on TV the same way again!\n\nI also did a \""""Hot Lap\"""", as passenger to Dream Racing owner (and former Formula 1 driver and Formula 3 world champion) Enrico Bertaggia, who showed me how it was really done.  The Hot Lap eclipsed any thrill ride out there, yet I always felt safe in hands of a master.\n\nNone of these race car experiences are cheap, but I can't imagine any are better value than Dream Racing (and they even chauffeured us to and from the Las Vegas Strip in a V12 Mercedes, which was an experience in itself!)

"Ordered the Thanksgiving take-out dinner. Very dissapointing. My husband liked the turkey so that's why I gave 2 stars. Everything tasted like it was frozen and the reheating instructions are to microwave pretty much everything. I realized getting a take-out dinner isn't going to be the freshest, but I've ordered from Whole Foods and Von's in the past and wasn't dissapointed. This meal however was terrible and very salty.

"Searched through yelp while trying to find something different around my house to eat other than the usual pizza or burgers that are so prevalent in the centennial/providence area and found this gem. They have been open only two months and already have a solid 4 star rating and now I know why.\n\nIt looks like it is just the owner, Warren, that works in the shop and it is a to-go place with no tables which was just fine with me. Since he makes everything fresh it is true that there may be a wait for your food, but it is worth it. While I was waiting for my sandwiches he fried up some free clam strips for me which was not only nice, but they were delicious- perfectly fried.\n\nSpeaking of fried, keep that in mind when you come here. All of the fish and shellfish is fried, but is cooked to perfection.\n\nAll I can say is that Warren picked a great location (right next to retro bakery) and I hope he is successful because he is a nice guy with a great product that is rather hard to find here in the desert.",1

"Thoroughly enjoyed our brunch here.  Service was impeccable.  We were promptly seated and served right away.  The white chocolate and orange french toast was wonderful!  It's texture is more of a cinnamon bun than a classic french toast, which I loved.  The flavors meld together very well.  We also had the tableau breakfast.  The pastry basket was delicious and did not need any of the yummy jams or butters. Chicken sausage was also delicious.  Too bad we were so full from all the food or else we would have gotten the souffle.  \n\nWill definitely come back for brunch here the next time I'm in town.  Am dropping my old favorite (Bouchon) off of the list because service and food has really declined over there.",1
"I'll start by saying this review is entirely based upon the food/wine quality, not the service. The maitre'd was very pleasant, seated me right away and my server was very pleasant and attentive. \n\nHaving said that, don't waste your time or your money coming here, coupon or convenience factored in. My lunch fare of a standard moules frites and glass of Sauvignon Blanc was beyond underwhelming.  My initial pour of the glass of wine was the end of an old bottle and tasted like it. When my entree arrived, the smallest mussels I've ever seen sat in my dish. The largest few in the dish were barely average-sized. I don't know if they scale lunch down, but given its attached to a convention center, they may want to re-think that. The best part of my meal was the fries. Let me tell you, that even as a French Fry luvah, their fresh, hand-cut fries weren't enough.\n\nOverall, skip this place and seek other options ESPECIALLY if you're not staying at the Palazzo or Venetian.",0
"SAD! So much potential, but missed it completely. Many times, when I first drive up to a place and I see 3 or more of the staff outside the back door smoking cigarettes I will hop back in my car and leave, but this place had really good write ups and we were in the mood for some super Italian food after working all day so we decided to give it a try anyway. We were readily greeted and seated, and water was brought to the table in no time at all. We had a few minutes to look over the menu. My husband and I decided we would each get a salad and then share an entree of linguine with clam sauce. I ordered the mixed green salad which was supposed to have greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and olives. I kid you not, there was only about one fourth of ONE olive on my whole salad and there was no onion whatsoever. There were greens, tomatoes and three half slices of cucumber with a tasty balsamic dressing for $8. What it should have cost was $4 at the most. My husband ordered the arugula salad topped with Gorgonzola cheese. The arugula greens were nice and fresh and the he enjoyed the balsamic dressing as well BUT his salad only had a minuscule amount of Gorgonzola on it ( three small pieces to be exact) $9  I must give credit where credit is due, their bread was really quite good. It was a flat bread that seemed freshly baked right out of their wood fired oven and then lightly brushed with olive oil and dusted with black pepper. Then linguine comes out. First thing I notice is there is no spoon served with the pasta dish. Well, I figured out real soon why there was no spoon because there was NO SAUCE (unless a tablespoon of sauce counts) also, about one third of the clam shells that were served with the pasta were void of any clams. One of the clams was still shut too. So, the tablespoon of sauce we did get was tasty, but really...how hard is it to add a bit of garlic, butter and white wine and put it on the pasta....there was no sauce! The whole meal was so sad because components of it were so good but then it was so messed up by the huge oversights. The homemade pasta noodles had delightful flavor yet so very very dry. I wanted to try the tiramisu for desert but by this point I knew what to expect so we passed. So very very sad. Bummer! It seemed like a restaurant that was skimping on everything because they were struggling not to go out of business. I would not return.",0

I'd never heard of it but soon learned through a quick Google search that it's a large roll (hence the name; cute but gross) with cream cheese and spicy mayo (even jalapeno, apparently, at some other places).  Barf.  If that's not nauseating enough, you should check out the \""""sushi desserts,\"""" which we found too terrifying to mock.\n\nStarving and desperate, we tried to order the most normal-sounding items on the menu.  Thank the lord, mine had to be freshly prepared and was acceptable, as long as I could shut the other stuff out of my mind.  My parents, poor souls, had to eat refrigerated sushi that had been made who knows when.  Tasted like cardboard.  I don't know what got into us, but we even took some back to the hotel for my brother-in-law, who must have thought my sister was leaving him.\n\nI'm all about innovation, evolution, and pushing boundaries.  But these ridiculous concoctions are criminal.  Just leave my sushi alone!!",0
"We paid $44 per person for dinner.\n\nHonestly, I really dislike buffets. Nothing ever really wows me or makes me mouth water so for me to find even one food item that I actually like is surprising. At Wicked Spoon, I found three.\n\nMission Figs- Blue Cheese and Candied Bacon\nWild Boar Sloppy Joe\nDuck Ravioli\n\nI really don't like bacon and blue cheese but man, the figs? So impeccably sweet, tangy, and salty with a bite. Amazing- I could probably gorge myself on just this.\n\nWild Boar Sloppy Joe- it had an interesting flavor that I can't really describe, only it was pulled meat and oh-so-good.\n\nDuck Raviolo- again, really interesting flavor. I really liked it though. It was extremely creamy and flavorful.\n\nThese three items alone would make me come here again. Buffets never really make me happy or excited except- maybe this one. As long as they had these items forever.",1
"Tried this restaurant per living social app and was surprisingly pleased by the food that they serve. The taste was splendid, original Thai food that really rare to find in the valley. Their Thai ice tea was perfect! Crispy tofu with peanut Thai sauce as appetizer was melting in my mouth! And my favorite Pad See Ew with beef was taste so good that I'm craving for more. They also were very generous in their portion. Overall I'm pretty sure I'll be back in this place for more Pad See Ew!",1
"I went here for a 'nice' steak dinner. however, i think 'nice' is actually 'bleh'.\n\nAll I wanted was a big, fat hunk of delicious meat and some healthy vegetables. Apparently they have vegetables but I wouldn't call them healthy. They have green beans, and I'm sure they are delicious with all the butter and bacon they are cooked in but I am 100% sticking to my New Years resolution. I asked instead if I could have fresh green beans cooked by themselves. My waitress said NO.\n\nNO?! you mean you don't have fresh vegetables?\n\nEverything they have is already premade and nothing is fresh. GROSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe steak was bland and I pretty much used an entire mound of salt for flavor. It ended up being like $20 bucks after tip. Totally ridiculous. \n\nI don't understand restaurants that don't use fresh vegetables and nothing can be cooked to order. that totally grosses me out. I will not be back. If I was by myself I would have left when I found out nothing was fresh, but I was with people and didn't want to insult them because one of them chose this place?",0
"Well, I already had this company install my system and am in a contract for services, but wanted to point out that most of these reviews are about ADT but the real problem seems to be with Protect Your Home- the authorized dealer... I myself had no clue that it wasn't ADT that I set up an appointment with; I do not feel like they were fraudulent in their ads but the print ads were very misleading. I also had a tech come out and tell me that all of my current sensors and motion detectors were not compatible with the updated system so everything would need to be purchased for $2000. I said NOT HAPPENING! Then, he left all the now non-working sensors up and just threw the old panel and stuff on the table. He was \""""nice\"""" but I didn't hire someone to be nice to me, I hired them to install a system so that my new home was protected. Also, he was there 3 hours! It is a small home, too. Anyhow, it is too late for me but for others I would say find another company. Oh, and who knows if this is the correct address for the company since they didn't provide me any of their info. I also received a bill on Saturday that said total due $49.99 but then said do not pay. I have no clue what they are up.",0
Another visit.  The pizza is adequate but is still blander than I like. I had an especially surly waitress.,0
"Awesome NY style pizza, great tasting sauce and just enough of it, and good quality cheese (not the rubbery stuff).  Slices big enough you need to fold--perfect!  Salad was nice too, very generous amounts of meat and cheese, and presented nicely.  Will go back next time we are in Charlotte",1
"If eating 36 ounces of froyo would not be classified as gluttenous, I would have filled 3 cups all the way to the top and totally justified the calories.

"If you want fresh produce hit a farmers market, if you want service go anywhere else.  The best thing is the amount of pre-made vegetarian options here, I love to pick up Amy's just to have on hand when they go on sale.\n\nProduce goes bad so quickly and a lot of times I finding it sitting in the display already bad.  I often find moldy tomatoes and onions sitting there, last week it was strawberries.  \n\nI do love the amount of chemical free shampoos and cleaning products they offer though, also they carry a large selection of non-dairy milk.",0
I've gone to the Mane twice and have been happy with both haircuts. I've had two different people cut my hair and it seems like everyone there has lots of experience. The only thing I wasn't totally satisfied with was the straight razor shave. It wasn't terrible but I've had better.,1
"The Food:\nSam Woo's has been shut down for health code violations a number of times within the past 10 years!  I was able to peak in their kitchen and noticed it was VERY dirty!  They had two huge pots with broth sitting on the floor.....on the floor!!!  \nThe Service:\nService staff currently works as though they were still living in China.  Culturally, American culinary (front and back house) service is very different from Chinese.  In China, people don't care if their server has the personality of a wall; they're only there to take their order and provide the food.  However, most Americans appreciate a server with a good personality and one who is genuine for the most part.  If you order a beverage, be sure to ask for a pitcher in advance because they only fill your glass up once....after that you've got to literally grab them by their shirt to stop them from brushing you off!  I feel as if there's better, more genuine customer service at McDonalds! \n\n-This place needs improvement in all areas\n\n*I've gotten the shits from this food every time I've eaten here!  I think that's saying something about their food.",0
"You can find this restaurant in a food court right next to CSN Charleston. I wanted to give this place out a try after the owner put their weekly special: Bourbon BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich with onion rings and soda/water for $8. Pretty good deal if you ask me! The food took awhile but that's because it was made to order, plus the wait was well worth it if you ask me! \n\nThis is definitely THE BEST Bourbon BBQ sandwich I've ever had! It was so juicy and tender. It wasn't hard to chew. And it was exceptionally flavorful! It was very delicious! The onion rings were perfect as well. It wasn't disgustingly oily or anything. I also tried the triple chocolate brownie.. BEST brownie I've ever tasted. I'm the biggest chocolate lover, and this is definitely my FAVORITE brownie! \n\nI would definitely recommend others to give this place a try! It's a new menu with new food! You won't be disappointed!",1
"I wish this eatery was much closer because it is so gooood! It really does make Paradise Bakery look like an amateur! Well balanced and creative breakfast dishes make me get up and drive way too far for my ever pain in the ass stomach!\n\nLunch is good too, although I cant remember what I had. Oh, yes it was asparagus soup! The bread is amazing dunked into any of their homemade concoctions. Makes me all warm and fuzzy inside! \n\nGreat spot for a business lunch apparently. The last time I was there, it was full of patrons pouring over their paper documents and laptops keys ticking away. I felt a little left out, but Kaleb and I had our own business to attend to.........filling the belly!",1
"I have tried to visit 3 more times since my first time and the place is always closed! I write this because the manager assured me that they would remain open til 7:30 every night! What is a 2nd shifter to do????   Hello, can i please get yours hours???",0
"Every once in a great while, you come across a place where, even after one visit, you know you'll be back for more. I'm sitting in the restaurant now, and feel the way I did when I had a new crush in high school: giddy. \n\nI can't exactly place it...maybe it's the generous portion of crinkle cut fries made to perfection or the creamy cheese sauce drizzled all over them. Maybe it was the fresh tasting burger, the lightly toasted sesame seed bun it came on, the cheddar cheese, or the special sauce that brought it all together. It's one of those burgers where you take the first bite and can't put it down...you don't even want to stop to use the ketchup you brought to the table specifically for the burger; it just disappears before you can realize what happened, and all you're left with is the fun music and fresh, clean atmosphere as you sit in the restaurant, wowed, and fantasizing about the next time you'll be back. \n\nI'm definitely coming back to try the Italian Beef and a shake. This place reminds me of home. Don't pass up an opportunity to have a great tasting burger for a reasonable price.",1
Disgusting.\nDangerous.\nDon't go.,0
"I had an AMAZING experience here and would absolutely recommend it to anyone!\n\nI made reservations for 7:45 and arrived around 8:00 due to Strip traffic. The host joked around about me being late (which I appreciated), but was able to seat me within five minutes despite the long line at the hostess desk!  The person who escorted us to our table was warm, welcoming, and hilarious to talk to!\n\nWhen making our reservation, we were advised that it would be for inside the restaurant and that outside seating would be first-come, first-serve (about a 90 minute wait at that time). However, we were seated on a deck area that was between the indoor seating and balcony seating. We LOVED this area because we still had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains without the wait (nor the drunks roaming the Strip). \n\nAs for the food, I had the filet mignon merlot, as well as escargot, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. The filet was SCRUMPTIOUS!  One of the best filets I've ever had and reasonably priced. It was so tender and flavorful, and I loved the merlot sauce!  It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. Additionally, the frites were delicious (albeit salty), especially when you dipped it in the merlot sauce.  I would not recommend the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, and the escargot was just mediocre. I was surprised they did not provide toast or pastry puffs with the escargot, but they did serve complimentary bread so it worked out. \n\nThe service at Mon Ami Gabi was great!  Everyone was extremely friendly and comfortable cracking jokes - which I liked. However, they were also efficient and accurate, which is equally important.  The view of the Bellagio fountains was the cherry on top!  The restaurant was not too noisy, especially compared to Sugar Factory. \n\nIf you are looking for a high-quality restaurant (especially a steakhouse) with a view of the Bellagio fountains, but cannot afford Bellagio's high-end restaurants, Mon Ami Gabi is the perfect place!  I will definitely return!",1
"This place has gone down hill since it lost its Hilton brand. \n\nBasically it feels really worn down, smelly and old. \n\nI stayed in room 433 and it reminded me of a convalescent home bathroom for senior citizens. With original tile floors and anti slip rubber mats. Definitely not up to Vegas standards by any means.\n\nBack to smells. In my room it smelled like cigs, sewage, mildew. The variety changes overtime so it makes you think about the filtration or piping in the system. This company needs to revamp its HVAC system. \n\nI want to thank the housekeeping crew for bringing us a iron replacement since ours broke. I appreciate the prompt service. \n\nDon't stay here unless you want to walk to CES or SEMA.",0
"I was so excited to try this place, such great reviews.  As soon as we got there the excitement turned to disappointment.  My husband and I decided on a last minute date night when I get off work.  I had been looking at this on yelp and it was on my list.  We went last night, Sunday, and got there about 8 pm (they closed at 9 pm).\n\nFirst we walked in, was not sure where to go since it was out first time.  Someone walked by and said the hostess will be back in a few minutes.  So we waited..and waited.  About 15 minutes later a hostess arrived.  We asked to be seated outside since it was beautiful out.  She was annoyed that the table she sat us at was directly against a bench which I kept hitting my elbow on.  We asked to move (there were a lot of tables) which annoyed her even more.  About 15 minutes later our server showed up (granted now the close in 30 minutes).  We asked for a cup of ice and lemons for our water multiple times...never saw those the whole meal.  She came to the table for our order and stated they only had 4 pizza's left so if we wanted pizza we needed to order immediately.  Since we had never been there, looking at the menu for 3-4 minutes was not enough time, but we wanted pizza.  We got a pepperoni like pizza and a sausage and potato white pizza.  We also ordered calamari as a appetizer.  \n\nWhen the food came out, all of it came at once.  This is my biggest pet peeve of restaurants!!  Appetizers come before a meal...not with it!  The calamari was nothing to talk about...frozen and bland.  The best thing about it was that we got the lemons with is, so we used those in our water.  The pizzas came out at the same time...again nothing great.  The crust was actually delicious, but there was hardly any cheese on them at all.  We asked for parm cheese, never got that either.  On the potato pizza the potatoes were still hard (under cooked) so we peeled them all off.  The pepperoni was okay, just needed more cheese.  The crust was the best part of the pizza.  \n\nThe food was okay...the service was horrible (never got what we asked for, drinks empty whole meal, and rushed to get everything since it was close to closing).  I think with this experience we will not come back here.  We drove over 30 minutes to try this place and it was a disappointment.  I know there are a lot of good reviews, but this is my view, which is not great.",0
"First time customer, glad I tried them!  Not knowing what their pizza would be like and the fact that they served by the slice made my decision easy.  I ordered 2 slices to start with, one had bacon, tomatoe, mushroom and onions and the other had meatballs, peperoni and tomatoes.  They were excellent, the crust was thin but not like a cracker, had a nice chewiness to it with a bit of crunch.  Nice home made sauce, not sweet like some or too spicy like others.  My wife says she has found a new pizza place and I'm sure we will be regulars.  Our third slice had meatballs, anchovy and tomatoes.  We were amazed at the quantity and quality of the toppings.  Of all the toppings, the meatball was our favorite.  The slice comes off of a 24 inch pizza so it is plenty to eat at $2.25 a slice and 35 cents per topping.  They make one great NY style pizza!!!  On each table there was parmesan cheese, oregano, red peper flakes, garlic salt and salt and pepper.  Can't wait to go back.",1
"I was not impress with the food at Cabo Wabo Cantina Las Vegas . I went there with my friend, because we were super hungry and we were craving Mexican food. \nThe portions are small and they are very, very pricy. \nWe spend over $60 for 2 plates. \nOur waiter was nice, but still it wasn't worth it. I can get the same meal for $20 some where else.",0
Chaparral Suites have big rooms that work great for a family of four. We stayed in a double queen and the pull out couch in the living area was nice for the kids to have separated beds. The rooms are on the older side but the entire hotel has lots of character. There is plenty poolside space to lay about.\nWe also enjoyed the cooked breakfast in the morning and the complimentary drinks in the evening. Looking forward to returning soon.,1
"1-888-NEON LIGHTS\nWow is all I can say when I walked into our suite. Yes, at $99 per night we got a 1 bedroom suite, complete with a washer and dryer, dishes, spices, and a huge tub & shower. ON MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND! Actually, every day of the year it is always $99 - and so much better than a majority of the strip hotels I've stayed at. There are granite counter tops, tile floors, balconies with furniture, a beautiful pool & jacuzzi area (so nice to see all those fabulous Las Vegas party bodies out there!) and the front desk staff will do anything you ask. It is also located within a few block of the best place for breakfast in Las Vegas (Blueberry Hill) and right down the street from the best of the new strip. The couch in the living room is fabulously comfortable and sits in front of a great flat screen TV with cable (so does the bedroom). One thing you will notice at once is there is no stale disgusting odors like there are in the strip hotels (like smoke), the linens are beautiful and clean and smell good (down comforters!), not like bleach and smoke! Also, the water pressure and faucet head in the shower will allow you to enjoy a nice shower. There is plenty of lighting in the room, even in the little corners. \n\nI can't say enough good things about this place. All suites is no joke. We even got a chance to do our laundry in our room before we left so there was no dirty laundry to do upon our return or packed in our bags with the clean laundry. \n\nPerfect!",1
"Me  and my friends didn't want to wait in the line that was 1 hour + across the street so we came here for brunch. I got their banana crepes and  and my friends had their eggs benedict along with some bloody marys and mimosas. We all thought the food was pretty good. The drinks were so so, but i don't think they are known for their bloodies. Service was good and we sat outside which was nice. Overall we all liked it",1
"Get the Vietnamese coffee - it is decadent. So delicious!\n\nThe Pho is wonderful. Their broth is absolutely delicious. I could just eat that. The beef is always tender and they give you just the right amount..not too much, not too little.\n\nThe service is good, they bring out your food quickly! Everyone seems very friendly. \n\nAfter eating here once, we were hooked. We have been enjoying Pho at least once a week since!",1
"If you're looking for a new pizzeria that offers pizza toppings that will leave you feeling a bit healthy without compromising on taste, then this is the place to be!",1
"Just thought I'd help some customers out.\nI've worked here for almost 2 years now and what i notice is the thing that deters people the most is the price. So i thoght I'd help you guys out. For most basic custard without a topping, so like a single vanilla will run you around $2.13. Not that bad, but if you were to get 4 for eexample that'd be around $8.50. If we were to serve perfectly each time, 4 single scoops would be a pint which we actually do sell for around $5.06. If you dont mind sharing a cup and just using 4 spoons. But if you want some topping and a decent amount of custard which im sure you do. You will want to order the not so much ordered BANANA SPLIT! For $4.99 plus tax you get 3 scoops of custard,your choice, a banana (of course), 2 toppings, and a nut. That beats any custard item on our menu besides our Concrete which is also very good.\nNow for the Grinders. There isn't really a way around the price besides getting a job here and getting an employee discount. but let me tell you THEY ARE WORTH IT!\nWith fresh cut deli meats, fresh bread made from a recipe passed through generations, and their DELICIOUS and often misinterpeted pepper relish. These sandwhiches AKA Grinders are the best I've ever had. Although everyone has their preferences my favorite which is mostly customized is \""""The Finer Turkey Bacon Melt Thingy!\"""" (not on menu). which is a grinder with; turkey, bacon, avacado, cream cheese, swiss or provolgne cheese, Xtra Xtra pepper relish, and the other grinder things such as; lettuce, mayo, onion, tomato, and etc. If you were to order this it'd be pretty pricey but if you are prepared to have the most delicious sandwhich of your LIFE! Then you should try it. Ask Nick to make it, he knows how it's done!\n(additional notes: The Ownership was changed about 2 years ago and there has been some changes, There is no longer any soup. Sorry. Also i've been told that there was a menu with different combinations for custard, which we do not have, but we do have a large list of topping that you can choose from and virtually make any flavor your heart desires.)\nCome check us out our number is 480-981-6368 and we are on the South-west corner of Power and Baseline. I'd say we are a bit hard to find but don't give up we are just around the corner of GoodWill facing Baseline.",1

"Maaan my first bad Yelp. This place is a customer service disaster... no hi. No how are ya. No kiss my ass nothing, stonewalled at the register. Tweaker bitch in the back busy doing laps.

Needs improvement to say the least.",0
"overpriced, overrated and bad service\n\nMy family and I (5 with three kids) decided to try Serendipity 3 after reading some great reviews on it in our hotel places to eat booklet.  They had it rated with Bouchons in the Venetian which is an absolutely great place to dine.  Serendipity was horrible..overpriced very basic root beer floats and shakes that cost half the total bill.  I've had much better in Johnny Rockets or McDonalds(seriously) for shakes. Service was bad.  It took about 30 min for those basic root beer floats and shakes.  Then the food was bland with no taste..I had chicken pot pie, my wife had the don't be afraid of my alfredo....be afraid of the Alfredo.  Olive Garden is better.  All the entrees were bad except for my sons wings...they were ok...not good but ok.  Don't fool yourself..this is not a good place to eat.  Vegas has so many other better choices.",0
"This place has a cute selection and is pretty affordable compared to the other meager shopping options currently on Mill, but if I'm in the mood to shop Pitaya wouldn't be one of my first choices. Maybe it was because I visited during the middle of a weekday, but I got the vibe that the salesgirl wished I would leave, because she was talking to a friend when I came in and I guess that my presence made her feel the need to talk in whispers. And when she did help me, she seemed annoyed about it.\n\nI did end up buying a couple of things from there, only to find the SAME EXACT SKIRT for maybe $8 cheaper at LoveCulture in Scottsdale Mall. I kid you not. If I can get the same clothes for cheaper elsewhere, then I don't think I'll be going back.",0
Took my car in for an oil change and was very impressed with the staff. They didn't try to up-sell me a thousand things I do not need and I was in and out quickly. I was even able to get some work done while I waited since they have free WiFi.,1
Really friendly staff! Out here on first friday had the falafel patty on the classic burger. Really delicious and really fresh food. Good prices as well. :),1
"This place was a flop. Was visiting a friend in Chandler and found this place on mobile Yelp. Had 68-something reviews and 4/5 stars which almost always means it will be a good place. Boy I was wrong this time.\n\nI hate those lengthy reviews talking about unimportant things so I'll stick to the main point. The restaurant itself was clean and you can sit down comfortably.\n\nThe waiter highly recommended the pork avodovo plate, which is pork that is served doused with either a green or red sauce with beans and rice on the side. I cannot take spicy food, and the waiter insisted the red version isn't spicy. My friend ordered the green version since he DID want spice.\n\nEnded up being the other way around...the red-sauce was oil-based and it was SPICY. My friend's green one was not spicy at all, and that was a more water-based sauce. He cleaned his plate and I barely touched mine. The waiter offerred to bring something else but I refused, barely having eaten any of it. I was put off by the waiter's \""""recommendations,\"""" and therefore assumed everything else was going to be ridiculously spicy. Plus, I shouldn't have to wait and then be delayed from leaving there for another 45 mins. I did tell him it was too spicy for me to eat and I didn't like it. He still charged me for it! I felt like I was robbed...I hate paying for something and then getting NOTHING. And I hate when restaurant waiters make you feel like you are obligated to like something when you really don't...and if you don't, they tend to argue with you about your dislikes. Same thing happened here. I didn't want to make a scene here either regarding the check, so I left hungry and paid for a second dinner at a fast food joint afterwards. What a waste.\n\nI don't see why this place got rave reviews...the food came out in minutes and was as if it were just sitting ready reheated in the back kitchen.\n\nMy friend ordered the creme brulee for dessert and that was not good at all...served at the extreme bottom of a large soup bowl and was really thin and had a metallic taste...yuck. There are tons better places in this city.\n\nWould so NOT recommend this place to anyone.",0
"having been to Fuego for group events I thought it would be good to go back with my girl friends for a regular dinner.  \n\nI made a reservation for 7:30, when we arrived we were still waiting for one more so they had us sit in the center of the patio on the bench instead of seating us at our table.  The patio was almost full but not out of control.  \n\nAfter about 10 minutes the hostess asked us if we would like a drink and if we would be more comfortable at our table.  We chose to sit at our table and waited for a server to come by, we waited...and waited....and waited.  After 30 minutes of waiting for someone to take our drink order I went to the hostess to complain and put in an order for a bottle of wine.  About 20 minutes later a server came by with the bottle, the bottle was corked, not all that uncommon, I ordered another bottle and was brought 10 minutes later, the wine was fine, we asked if we could place our food order, we had already been sitting at the table for more than an hour at this point.  He said \""""I will be back in 30 seconds\"""", about five minutes later he came back to take our order.  The server returned 20 (we started watching the clock and keeping track since they never acknowledged us for drinks) and said \""""I'm just going to put the words out there and bear the brunt of what I get...we are out of mashed potatoes.\""""   I could not believe that he started what he had to say like that, and that he didn't have anything in his hand to make up for the inconvenience of our entire meal by this point.  We adjusted our orders (we all ordered mashed potatoes).  Our food arrived 10 minutes later, vegetables were cold, meat was good.\n\nI should mention that about 45 minutes after we sat down a 12 top sat down right behind us, their food and drinks arrived much before our own - we had the same server.  \n\nHaving held group events at Fuego I was incredibly disappointed that they could not handle a simple table of 4.\n\nWe asked the server what the problem was and he said that they checked their numbers from last year and they were not that busy in June and July.  He also mentioned that their most seasoned server was on vacation - one server does not make the restaurant funciton. They should have checked their numbers from last week, not last year, their popularity has increased over the last year.\n\nSuch a disappointment.",0
"I was referred to Dr. Rueckl by another dermatologist for removal of a small skin lesion using Mohs surgery.  Dr. Rueckl is one of just a couple of experts who do this type of surgery here in Vegas.\n\nI was very appreciative of his wonderful bedside manner, and found him completely honest:  since the lesion was on my leg, he advised against having it and suggested I have it removed in the traditional manner.  He said if it were he, he wouldn't do it!  But after thoroughly explaining the pros and cons, he ultimately left it up to me.  I decided to go with it, for reasons irrelevant to this review.  He said the procedure would be practically painless, and it was.  \n\nAt both the initial consultation and at surgery (in-office), I didn't have to wait very long before I was seen.  Dr. Rueckl has an easy-going personality, not standoffish at all, and at no time did I feel like I was being rushed.  I highly recommend him!",1
"I really wanted to like these cupcakes, but maybe I've just been spoiled by Chicago cupcakes.

"I would give Ginza 0 stars if I could!  This was truly the worst dining experience I have ever had.   \n\nMy husband took me to Ginza for my birthday.  Upon entering, the restaurant stunk, like dirty wet dog.  They sat us in one of the little private rooms, where you have to take your shoes off and climb in to this Japanese style table.  I could literally feel dirt, dropped food etc on the floor.  The paint and wallpaper were peeling off.  It was shocking how run down it was.  Our waiter took about 15 minutes to finally appear.  He was sweating and obviously frantic.  He took our drink orders and took another 15 minutes to return.  We placed our orders, and waited.  While we waited, 2 servers attempted to bring us food that was not ours.  Everyone seemed to be confused and rushed.  My husbands food arrived.... And we waited some more.  He ordered the hibachi.  I ordered sushi.  My food was MIA.  My husband was completely finished by the time my food arrived.  The sushi was not fresh.  Some of it I couldn't even eat.  We decided to skip dessert and just get out of there.  When the server finally brought our bill, it was hand written and very confusing.  i asked the server to explain all the charges.  I pointed out that we were charged for my husbands salad, which was included on the meal. The server went and changed it.  I asked what the charge was at the bottom, and he said it was our drinks.  But they were included above.  I finally asked to see the manager, and he explained that extra charge was an 18% gratuity already included because we were sitting in the little private room.  What?  Are you serious?  We complained about the service and food, and the botched bill, and the manager gave us the meal for free.  While I appreciated the effort to make it better, We will never return.  Don't ever go there!  That place should be shut down!",0
"Really good coffee. I stopped in for the first time on a Monday afternoon and ordered a hot caramel latte with almond milk and a ham and cheese croissant. Everything  except the service was great. Let's just say the place didn't put off a very welcoming vibe.  Perhaps I came in on an off day? However, the coffee was so good, I will give it another try...there is always something to be said for quality :)",1
2 words: Food poisoning. \n\nMy stepdad and I both got food poisoning from Garcia's...not pleasant.,0
"It's the worst Thai Express. Very bad customer service. I told the girl I wanted my meal to be spicy (she is supposed to ask me but she didn't so I said it myself). After I didn't see her put it on the bill, I asked her: it will be spicy right? She said yes. And guess what? Not only it wasn't spicy at all, but the pad sew was so dry. I took a take out so I couldn't waste more time to go back. She charged extra when I asked for a bowl instead of the usual tight box when the other Thai Express don't do that. Not only I didn't get something worthy of the money I was paying, the cashier was just busy chattering with her colleagues and didn't pay attention to giving the right service.",0
"At first glance, this is a great community. The dog parks and pools are the best part of this place. And thats where the greatness ends.\n\nTHE STAFF IS HORRIBLE!!!!! They do not return phone calls, and basically have their heads up their butts, because there is no communication between the corporate office and all their residences...\n\nI heard good things about Mark Taylor Residences,which is why we looked at this place, but after living with them for over a year, \nI WILL NEVER, EVER RECOMMEND LIVING HERE. \nThey overcharge for rent, and dont tell you when your rent is being raised. They also require a 60 day to-vacate notice, not a 30 day, and they dont tell you that either. READ THE FINE PRINT. Otherwise, you will get screwed. Oh, and make sure that you look at an apartment that you would actually be getting, because they show you the better one of the two. We got all old appliances and old carpet, but they showed us a nicer place, saying it was the same rent. When we went to move in, they said \""""oh you have to pay more for that one you looked at.\"""" Freaking idiots. Come to find out, our neighbor paid the same rent and had all those new things that we were excited about in the beginning. When we brought it up to a manager, we didn't receive a call back. Figures...\n\nEven after moving out, we are still getting screwed. We had our address changed with the office, and even after going to the office a second time to make sure it was changed, they still didn't do it. My fiance's mail for the last month and a half has been being sent back to the post office, bills included. \n\nSO THANK YOU VERY LITTLE MARK TAYLOR RESIDENCES, FOR SCREWING OVER YOUR RESIDENTS! \n\nDO NOT MOVE IN HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"Remarkable pizza and salad. We visited from San Antonio, TX and my in-laws recommended Buon Gusto. All 7 of us went, 4 adults and 3 kids and the kids all said it was the best pizza they have ever had. It was very good pizza. Service was great. All fresh, organic and the right temperature.",1
"Supposedly the oldest Mexican restaurant in the area, we were directed here by our concierge.  The place has a kitchy, almost 80's feel, but it needs some updating.   The menu is a bit too \""""American\"""" for me; if you expect a truly authentic experience, this is not the place.  I think they get a lot of tourists here, who are used to the more Americanized dishes.  \n\nTo start, the salsa is extremely tasty - very fresh - although the chips seemed \""""bag\"""" quality.  After that, it was all downhill.  Two stars is a gift - it's closer to 1 star.  For lunch, we had the machaca - dry, shredded beef with peppers and tomatoes, and a combo plate of chile relleno and a corn tamale.  The plates look like a disaster when served; sauce everywhere, very disorganized.  The plates came out so hot they must have been microwaved - not a good sign at a respectable restaurant.  Too much sauce, also a sign of laziness and lack of attention to detail.  The rice was not great - not made fresh, and also crisp on top from the microwave (or taken from yesterday's rice pot).  The refried beans were a flavorless mash of canned beans; avoid.  The machaca shredded meat itself was somewhat flavorful, but again it appeared that they make it day(s) earlier and then re-heat it after slapping it on a plate.  Not authentic. The flour tortilla was huge and actually the best thing I tasted, other than the salsa.  Americanized, large plates of re-heated slop.  My advice - find a REAL Mexican restaurant, and stay away from this joint.",0
Like always I am glad to try out new hotels while taking my every 6 months trip to Vegas. And I was very impressed with this tourist trap hotel. The rooms were much bigger than ones I have stayed at in the same area. With a ton of gaming machines I don't find everywhere. I would definitely stay at this place again if were an option.,1
"I really wanted to give this place a better rating, I really did.  The food at King's Kitchen is amazing (though a tiny bit pricey) and the restaurant seems to have a really great purpose.  However, after the treatment we got on our anniversary I doubt I'd ever go back.  My husband and I went to the restaurant to celebrate eleven years of marriage.  We were expecting a special event, especially after reading all the glowing reviews.  What we got was a waitress who treated us like dirt, while treating her only other table at the time like old friends.  \n\nWe sat at our table, and when we saw a woman roll her eyes as she stared our way I whispered to my husband \""""Oh man.  I hope she's not our waitress.  She looks like she hates us already!\""""  Lucky us, here she came.  She said nothing about specials, gave us no suggestions, had to come back to hear our drink orders TWICE, and all we ordered was tea.  And ten minutes later, when a couple of women sat in her section across from us, we got the jealous privilege of watching her gush all over these ladies, telling them in detail the specials and what came with them, which dishes were good and even telling one of the women to try a dish she had told five minutes earlier me was SOLD OUT.  What?  And while our appetizer sat on the counter where we could see it, she held a ten-minute conversation with these ladies about the conference they were attending and oh my gosh, we're all from the same hometown?  What a coincidence!  Let's talk some more!  After that the loud PLUNK as our appetizer was carelessly thrown on our table was audible throughout the restaurant.  Before we could even request a refill on our tea, she was gone, back to finish the conversation our appie had so rudely interrupted.\n\nWe didn't get our food for forty minutes, during which time we got to watch our neighbors, who arrived fifteen minutes after us, dig into two plates of delicious-looking food.  By the time we got our tepid but delicious meals we had already been in the restaurant for an hour and twenty minutes and we were actually feeling like nuisances.  We honestly should have complained to a manager, but we had to get to our other anniversary plans.  If I had it to do all over again I would have said something.  As it is they've lost us as customers.  If I'm going to pay that much for dinner, I'd like to be treated like a human being at least.  \n\nThe funny thing is the ladies and that waitress had more than their hometown in common, and though I'd hate to think prejudice came into play, it seems to be a very plausible possibility.  I just don't know why a woman who is so friendly to other people could look at us and decide we were worthless scum without knowing us.  But that's what happened.  The difference in the way they were treated and the way we were treated was astoundingly obvious.",0
"HORRIBLE DRY CLEANER. DO NOT USE. \n\nDropped off around 20 items for dry cleaning, and at least 4 came back totally ruined. Buttons were broken, ink stains were on several items (like from a ballpoint pen) that had not been present when I dropped off the clothing. \n\nStains I had mentioned and asked them to try to remove were still present, and they didn't make any notice of this or let me know that they were unable to remove said stains. Several stains looked untouched, like they hadn't even made an attempt to remove them. A few silk items I dropped off came back feeling like a strange texture, like they were very stiff. When I complained, no explanation was offered and the best they could do was take the items with ink for a free redo. They were practically already ruined, so I let them try. Around 300 dollars of clothing was ruined by this dry cleaner. Awful, awful service.",0
"This is my second visit and it pretty much put a nail in the coffin. The first time we came in for a late breakfast and the food was mediocre but we chalked it up to being on the tail end of breakfast service. However, the second chance did not prove redeeming. I ordered the Cali benedict and the poached eggs were beyond runny and the dish was bland. The potatoes are greasy and hard. Hubby's omelet was greasy and runny, as well. Have not had lunch or dinner but would be reluctant to come back based on both poor breakfasts. There's other amazing places for breakfast in the area.",0
Excellent food with great service.,1
"Not sure what is happening, but two visits and two messed up orders.  Both times it took them more than an hour and half to prepare our pizza.  The first time they apologized for the \""""slow service\"""" and the fessed up that they lost our order.  Six weeks latter - they DID EXACTLY THE SAME THING AGAIN. Not only did they lose our order, but then when we got home they gave us the wrong salad order.  Their pizza is not good enough to justify this type of wait.  We will look for another pizza place that manages their orders better.",0
"Wow, I had a wonderful time at Shine's Blow Dry 101 class on Friday!   (Thanks Nicole for planning another awesome event!)\n\nWhen I arrived, I was offered wine, Vitaminwater cocktails, cheese, crackers, and fruit.   After group introductions,  we were shampooed and paired with different stylists based on our challenges.  I worked with Christina, who was awesome!  She was very patient and was able to really show me how to properly straighten and blow-dry my thick tresses while minimizing the frizzies. \n\nI have always been challenged in terms of styling my own hair... manual dexterity has never been my strong suit.  But to make matters worse, none of my stylists have ever taken the time out to really show me the proper methods for drying and styling my hair.  But, I learned some fool-proof techniques for everyday styling that will make a real difference! \n\nI learned that I was using the wrong brushes for my hair's length & thickness, and I was thrilled to purchase the proper tools.  I also was able to try a couple of new products that worked well for me and also was able to add those to my arsenal as well. \n\nEveryone at the Salon was awesome and made me feel really welcome and special - kudos to the entire team!\n\nI also enjoyed my lip makeover from Jeffre Scott & look forward to checking out his shop as well!",1
"Went here for my daughters bachelorette party.  Crowd was very small, but Marc worked it none the less.  I have been to hypnotists before, and they are really not my thing.  But, I thought it would be fun for the girls.  We had a few get on stage, and then the bachelorette went under in the audience.  I was pissing myself!  His comedy was adult, but not raunchy.  I was very pleased with the experience.  The draw back-the video they sell was awful.  One of our girls was in the last chair onstage and was never in the shot, which is just a still of the stage the whole time.  Pretty generic, but captured it I suppose.  For the price it's good fun.  Go with a brave group and let loose.",1

"You know what this place deserves a great review from me. Yeah, yeah I know what you're thinking \""""Jamie it's just a Red Lobster\"""". It is a Red Lobster and I am a regular customer here because my dad loves this place and honestly I don't have anything bad to say about them. Their service has always been spectacular; all of their wait staff have been nothing but fun and friendly to my very dysfunctional family. I've had many items on the menu and have enjoyed everything. Not to mention, they have a great bar. Where else can I get a double sized frozen margarita with my seafood meal? This place handles large parties gracefully and easily splits checks when needed. This Red Lobster has served me and my family well for years. I love the different \""""fest\"""" seasons too, Lobster Fest being my favorite!",1

"My husband and I entered the Steaks R Us building and were suprised to see it empty.  The advertisement stated it was dine-in, but we were directed by the staff to order our meal at the front counter, even after I stated we wanted to dine-in.  The gentleman took our order and added a 18% tip onto the check for himself!  I did a quick math in my head and asked if he added a tip on the check for himself.  With a straight face he said, \""""We are supposed to add a tip on the check.\""""  We had just ordered 2 Porterhouse steaks!!!!  He gave himself a over $11.00 tip for making us order our food at the counter!!!!\n\nBEWARE!!!",0
"There are so many reasons to give this Bashas only one star (or less).  My first complaint is the lack of staffing either available, or willing to help.  Rarely do they have more than one or two aisles open for checkout, and even the self service checkout is run by one of the cashiers inconveniently located at the single open checkout lane.  Therefore, anyone checking out in self service that has (1) any alcoholic beverages, (2) any coupons, (3) has to input their phone number for their Bashas \""""rewards\"""" because they don't have their card with them ,(4) wants to pay by check, (5) has fruit/vegetables that don't show up on the screen as options, (6) well....you get the point - ALL have to wait for the cashier to leave their station to come re-instate your checkout after it's been frozen by the automated system.  In addition, this morning I ran into Bashas on my way to work for my staple morning Diet Coke, and EVERY lane (including all of the self checkout lanes) was roped off except one.  There were no less than 6 people in line ahead of me, all with significant groceries, and the checkout clerk (who was working at the speed of molassas) didn't call for additional assistance until 4 more people joined the line behind me.  And even then, no one came to help.  \n\nIn addition to the terrible (and terribly slow) service, the location of products on occasion mystifies me.  Why is the canned tuna located in the Asian section?  Why are tortillas located at the end of the chip aisle (rather than the Mexican section?)  The don't even CARRY Truffle Oil!  \n\nThe only thing I really like about this Bashas is it's cool wine chiller.  Place a room temperature bottle of wine in the chiller for no more than 4 minutes, and you're ready to join your party with a perfectly chilled Chardonnay.  That is why they get the one star I'm offering them.",0
"I love Papa John's but just not at this location.\n\nLike the others have said, the \""""crust\"""" is too fluffy and not crispy. I normally look forward to dipping the crust in the garlic sauce, but didn't bother this time. So very disappointed with this place.",0
"Was looking forward to dinner here with girlfriends but was very disappointed. We arrived early with plenty of open seating but they sat us in the bar anyway.  Hostesses should gauge the type of diner when choosing a location in which to seat them, not just server load management. Not overly impressed with menu, especially the dinner salads...more like lunch-size, but tasty.  Waitress not very friendly, seemed indifferent at best.  Bar got crowded and\nbecame so noisy we could hardly hear each other.  Looks like a good place to go if you want to eat meat and drink, but not for a \nnice 'catch-up' dinner with friends. Used a Groupon to try the place... but probably won't be back.",0
"Arrogant people. This place just rip people off. I have a Q5 and had to go to Tucson to buy it. I was actually going to go to CA where they had the A4 for $249 lease/mo compared to 379 in Scottsdale (very basic car), Q5 at $499 lease/mo premium plus compared to 549 premium for a lease in AZ, but fortunately Audi Tucson was able to match the price offered in CA. Otherwise Audi North Scottsdale won't  negociate I guess because like they say they are able to sell cars over the sticker price and rip pple off easily. Horrible that they say that representing Audi. My next car will be the R8 and I won't buy it at Penske Dealers. Audi Peoria was by far the worst one offering a monthly pmt of $769 for a lease on a Q5 MSRP $38,725. I would recommend pple NOT TO BUY AN AUDI IN AZ, Chandler, Scottsdale or Peoria. Paul, sales person with Audi North Scottsdale, actually told me to go and get my car in Tucson, Arrogant mf",0
"First of all: this is a hidden gem of Mexican fare in Sin City. The location is surprising, and so are the wonderful people who work at El Dorado.

Different fresh juices made daily, flan which will bring a tear to your eye, truly authentic & extremely delicious Mexican food which will endear all who are lucky to eat at El Dorado. Wait until you see the decor---festive & exotic and lots of space to bring your family or a group of friends. I would bet my car you'll LOVE this place! \u00a1Es muy fantastico!",1
"Well I used to like this mall, however, they have \""""new\"""" owners.The prior owner and manager turned out to be a real crook and stole revenue from many dealers. This all happened about a year - year and half ago. After a big fallout, nearly half the mall moved out. Enter the \""""new\"""" owners, who I hear are from Texas? These people have tons of stuff, that apparently they have been selling out of state prior, most of it is from their own collections one could gather?  Slowly they have been staging their merchandise to look like individual collections and dealers for months. Over the past year what was left of the original dealers have since moved out, to other malls. The prices are higher than all the malls in Arizona. Perhaps they think they are in California? Santa Fe? They run an Auction service through the mall, but be careful, a good amount of the action items come from the floors and walls of the mall. They also have an Antique Store on eBay under the store name: Continental Collectibles and under the seller name of azantiquecentre. Just check out there eBay approval rating...OVER 500 NEGATIVE ratings from customers. It's almost unheard of to have a rating under 90% (their rating is 87%) on eBay without doing something wrong. Pretty sad if you ask me?  So this afternoon I venture into their store, I have not been in the place for 6-8 months prior. On my way out, I was \""""Detained\"""" because they thought I had stolen a piece of art on July 1st. They had a blurry security camera photo that was kinda close but as I pointed out, without my reading glasses on, that there were MAJOR differences. But they called the Scottsdale police anyway. I'm 68 year old male and have never been arrested for anything in my life. I was shocked that they would not spend a few seconds comparing the photo with the person standing in front of them. After an hour of questioning and harassment the cops let me go. A bad experience in a bad Antique Mall that will remain bad as long as it's current owners and manger run it. If you don't think so, then just ask all of the former dealers that use to rent spaces from them. Currently I think there are maybe three or four left. 90% of that inventory comes from these \""""new\"""" owners.",0
"Finally found a Chinese restaurant in my hood! \n\nWe've ordered take out 4 times within the last 2 weeks if that give you any idea of how much I like this place. I don't know how, but the takeout food is still HOT once you get it home and start making your plate. I personally love this, because who wants to nuke something 20 mins after picking it up? Not meeeee. \n\nQuick service - take out was FAST and the restaurant was packed. Reasonable prices 7-12 range for dinner. LARGE servings (1 order of Cashew Chicken can be 2-3 meals for me. My husband more like 1-2 meals). \n\nWe've been happy with everything we've ordered. Flamingo chicken is my hubs favorite, but we've also done chicken fried rice, egg friend rice, beef & broccoli, kung pao chicken and cashew chicken (mentioned above) and its all awesome. Except the Kung pao - but that's probably my fault because I asked them to not make it super spicy, as I'm not a fan and it was lacking flavor in general. (but like i said probably my own fault.) \n\nCan't wait to try more!",1

"It is late at night. You are hungry and staying in a downtown hotel. What are you options? Trendy nightspot (too dressy and you're too old), hotel room service/ restaurant (overpriced slop with an added service charge), dragging your self across town to open shop (I don't think so). \n\nEnter Restaurant Saigon! Cheap food, Cheap Flavor, but good times. I had the General's Chicken. It was no gourmet, but it hit the spot.",0
"I'm usually a huge fan of ramen, but this restaurant just did not do it for me. I ordered the Tom Yum ramen, hoping it'd have a sweet/sour soup base. However, the ramen soup was really salty and tasteless at the same time. I didn't even know this was possible. Unfortunately, instant ramen tasted better than what I had. Definitely won't be coming back again!",0
