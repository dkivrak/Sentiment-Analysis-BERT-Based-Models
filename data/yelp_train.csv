"Great spot in downtown Mesa. Every time I come here I have ordered something different. I've gotten Pad Thai, Curry Chicken and this time I got Thai Fried Rice. My girlfriend got Pad See Ew so we were able to mix it up and share everything. This last visit earned it an extra star. \n\nService has been inconsistent. I've had really fast service, and really slow service. This time was really fast. The food tasted the best ever too! We also asked to make the food very spicy and they listed. We did have to reassure them a few times that we can handle it. I guess they have a lot of people who want spicy but can't handle it. \n\nThis place has a great ambiance to it, I can see it being pretty romantic at night but I've only eaten here for lunch.  \n\nIn addition... I always get a small egg roll and some soup with every meal which is very tasty.",1
"I have given this place several chances, each time hoping it will be better than the last. The food is good, no complaints there, yummy carb-ful comfort food and okay salads. \n\nProblem is the service, or lack thereof I should say. On my first visit I sat on the patio for a full 20 minutes with no service, not even a greeting. I finally asked one of the servers who was cleaning off a table a few feet from me if I could order something to drink and have a menu. The second and third visits were pretty much the same, I didn't have to ask to be served but took them a long time to finally come to my table.\n\nMy last visit, just last week, I sat at a table on the patio and was never greeted or served, after 30 min I left.\n\nToo bad, this place has great potential as a neighborhood hangout but after talking to others, it is well known that the service is poor.",0
"Wish there was a 0 star option. My mother in law got a manicure and gel polish...the tech that did her nails left gel polish on her skin and didn't try to take it off when she mentioned it to him. I got a pedicure and it was not relaxing at all. My nails weren't filed evenly, and there was polish all over my skin. When the tech was done painting my nails she immediately put my sandals on and told me to go pay. I asked her if they were dry enough and she said \""""probably not.\"""" I wish I would have saved myself the $25 and gone somewhere else.",0
"While looking for a lunch place in Mesa on Yelp, I came across Dooby's.  So I met my wife there.  They could have used someone with an eye for design, as the decor could be classified as thrift-store-restaurant-chic.\n\nWe started out with a hummus appetizer, which also came with kalamata olives, salted pickles, pepperchinis and shug (which is something new I've never had, a mixture of olive oil, cilantro, garlic and chili flake ground together).  The shug was fabulous!  The hummus was tasty, albeit a little chunky.  I prefer a smoother puree.\n\nMy wife ordered the shwarma/gyro combo, while I went with the shwarma plate with 2 side falafel.  The lunch combos came with an Israeli salad, which never arrived at our table.  Hmmm.\n\nMy wife found the chicken shwarma and gyro meat to be overcooked and dry.  She also though either the chicken or the mayo-based garlic sauce drizzled over it tasted funny.\n\nI got used to the garlic sauce after a couple of bites, and cleaned my plate.  The falafel looked almost like little muffins, and were pretty good.\n\nWe ordered the baklava.  How to describe it in one word?  Dry.  They must have found this bad boy in the Gobi Desert.  Baklava is supposed to be moist with a honey simple syrup, which they must have been short of.\n\nI had to temper my first reaction, which was to call out the kitchen staff and have each of them take a bite while berating them, a-la Gordon Ramsey.  I love that Hell's Kitchen.\n\nThe owner visited our table, and was very welcoming, very friendly.  However, I just cannot recommend this establishment with so many other great Mediterranean restaurants out there, such as Phoenicia Grill and Haji-Baba.",0
"The Super Burrito and Taco Salad were amazing. It's a nice small restaurant with a walk up counter. Even if you don't live in the neighborhood, it's worth the drive.",1
"This is where I fell in love with carne asada burrtios!\n\nWhen I moved from Chicago to Phoenix, I had no idea what Mexican food could be.  This was the first place I had tried because it was within walking distance to home & school.  I must have eaten here twice a day for an entire semester.  Today it's more of an after-the-bar treat.  This is the benchmark for all burritos.   You may feel the need to high five someone after eating one.\nI can only relate in analogy. It is Garfield's lasagna, Bert's oatmeal, Laestragonian's Acheans, Olympian Ambrosia, and Elvis's peanut butter and banana freakin' sandwiches all wrapped into a burrito.",1
"This place is fucking annoying. \n\nFirst of all, it's not on Priest. It's on Ray. So after I drove back and forth across the intersection three times, on a hunch I turned on Ray and shazaam, there it was. \n\nSecond: There is a sleazy jerk who came at me with the \""""excuse me, MISS, excuse me, MA'AM\"""" line that sent my bullshit detector into the red zone. He proceeded to tell me that the chip in my glass isn't \""""that bad right NOW\"""" but they can go ahead and contact my insurance company on my behalf to get it taken care of. Newsflash, fuckstick, there are no chips in my glass. Six pieces of glass on the car plus mirrors - no chips! Imagine that! \n\nThird: I got the air filter upsell. The air filter is 4 months old. \n\nOne star goes to good vacuuming up the dog hair.",0
"On any given day, the breakfast dishes at Marigold range from phenomenal to un-freaking-believably-good. \n\nOn any given day, the service system at Marigold ranges from mildly inconvenient to mind-blowingly frustrating. \n\nThere are enough reviews here that sing the praises of Marigold's food. I wholeheartedly agree with them all - so instead I'm going to try and offer some suggestions that can help you navigate the conundrum that is Marigold's seating situation. As noted per other reviews, you stand in line to order at the counter - then wait in the little waiting area - then an employee leads you to a table. At least, that's how it's supposed to work. \n\nOn my most recent visit, however, people were grabbing tables while they were still in line. These folks probably didn't see the teeny tiny sign outside the restaurant that lays out the table etiquette - most likely due to the fact that the sign is indeed, teeny tiny. When this happens, Marigold employees have to decide whether to 1) ask these people to get up, which is awkward or 2) let them sit there, which screws over people waiting patiently after ordering at the counter. \n\nI think Marigold could do a better job of communicating the seating policy  -either by having a full-time host at the front of the restaurant or posting more signage. Probably both. \n\nUntil they change the policy though - I would not suggest dining at Marigold with a large group unless you arrive very early or late in the dining cycle. I would not suggest eating at Marigold if you want to sit and chat for an hour or two over food (you will feel awkward with people staring at you while waiting for your table). \n\nWhat I will suggest is going to Marigold with a small group, 2-4 people, and following the seating etiquette. The employees will find you a spot - and if others are snagging tables before they're supposed to - give them the stink eye or say \""""screw it\"""" and grab a table yourself. \n\nThe experience is less frustrating if you know what to expect - and the food at Marigold really is worth it.",1
"My husband and I stayed here for two nights and almost left during the night on our second night stay. The beds were absolutely atrocious and very outdated! I mean c'mon... they had a piece of plywood as support for the lumpy outdated mattress?! The room service was VERY expensive and for what you paid for you got very little of. The pools were pretty bad too, my husband noticed empty water bottles (trash) floating on top of the water. The only positive to our stay is that they don't charge for pets to stay there. Of course we were put in a funky smelling room due to it being a pets room but I think that comes with the territory when you travel with your pet.",0
Overpriced: Not only the food itself but also the medical bill and the gym personal trainer bill you have to pay afterward.,0
"First of all I would like to say that this is a very nice hotel.  The staff were pleasant and the decor is very up to date.  The design of the pool area is very modern and compliments the hotel well. There's a nice selection of bars and restaurants through out the hotel providing many different options for the guests. The rooms are very modern and provide an array of lighting options in them.\nMy issues with the hotel started in the room.  The door to the bathroom slides shut on a rail that has no stopper so when I went to open it I slid the door too far and it fell off of the rail trapping me in the bathroom until my girlfriend had to come and rescue me.  I would have to say that's an extremely poor design on the door, at least have some kind of stopper in place.  The next issue I had were the maids/cleaning ladies.  While we were away they came in the room to straighten up for us.  The night before I had a small bloody nose that leaked a few spots on our white pillow cases.  The cleaning ladies remade our bed with the same sheets and spotted pillow cases.  The rooms come with a $40 a day food credit that we could use inside of the hotel but that was never told to us and we had to find out through another guest after we had already ate at different restaurants outside of the hotel.  We then had to argue with the guest services representative about removing the charges from food purchases in the hotel. \nAs nice as the hotel is the experience could have been much better. I've stayed in almost all the major hotels in Las Vegas and though they have their issues non compared to the amount I had to go through in one weekend at The SLS",0
"So after dinner, me and my bf wanted to stop by here to try a cupcake. They're a few stores down from the sea life aquarium so its in that area. When I saw the cupcakes, I was immediately blown away about how huge they were. My bf suggested that we share one since they're double the size of regular sized cupcakes. What surprised me was the fact that there were two guys operating the shop, but since the owners were men, the employees were men too so it made sense. Me and my bf got the pink Cadillac since I've heard raving reviews about it. I wasn't too thrilled about the pink frosting cause it tasted like it was sweetened with splenda or sweetnlow. The vanilla buttercream center tasted a lot better. The next time I go here, I'll try a vanilla one.",1
"This place was conveniently located right next to the Best Western Inn we were staying at!\n\nMy father brought his piano and I brought my guitar so we could show off our skills to the Mesa locals. Although the locals we were with only consisted of 5, we managed to get our show up and going.\n\nPops needed a sustained foot petal for his keyboard. I needed some electric guitar strings, strap and picks as my setup is torn up due to hardcore rocking out. \n\nNice selection of guitars and basses with a subpar selection of pianos. Turns out Milano Music actually has an entire store across the street with looked dedicated strictly to pianos and piano related products. The brass section was kind of cool.. it's on the second level with about 4ft wide walk space and railing along the sides. A little intimidating, but once you get over the fact that you may or may not fall off this thing or it may collapse, well.. then everything begins to feel alright.\n\nI was helped by an unnamed gentleman who took me right to the section I needed to be at. I'm an intermediate guitar player (in my head I like to think this), so I still have questions every now and then. When it comes to strings.. there's plenty of brands to choose from and all have claim to fame. Luckily the dude who was helping me out inquired my set up and pulled down the strings he thought suit best for me. To top it off, he even put in a 2 for 1 deal for me so I can try out a few different brands for a cheaper price. Thanks, brotha. \n\nMy father was helped by a young dude who found the exact foot pedal that came with my dads previous keyboard setup. Bing, bang, boom. Naturally we were in Milano for hours fiddling around, but if I needed something on the fly and happen to be in Arizona.. I feel the staff as well as the selection here would easily get me in and out and on the go.",1
"When you stay at a place as historied and revered as the Arizona Biltmore, you expect to be wowed. You expect the place to live up to the reputation you and your husband -- both Phoenix natives -- have heard about all your lives. You expect to be truly impressed. Unfortunately, were not.\n\nOur disappointment began at the get-go, with the less-than-friendly reception from our front desk clerk. No \""""Hi, welcome to the Arizona Biltmore!\"""" No \""""Thanks for staying with us.\"""" I don't think she even cracked a smile throughout the entire check-in process.\n\nOur disillusionment continued when we received our bill, which included a $28 \""""resort fee.\"""" When we sought clarification, the front desk clerk (not  Miss Surly) sweetly explained it was a fee for hotel services, such as phone, Internet, the business center, shuttle, etc. - none of which we even used. Yet, we were expected to pay for them. I think the traditional pay-for-play method would be a whole lot more equitable.\n\nFinally, since I had about two hours to kill between check out and my next commitment, I inquired at the concierge desk if they had a small fridge where I could park my leftovers from the previous night's dinner while I shopped in the area. Grudgingly, the man behind the counter agreed to the request. A \""""Sure, no problem!\"""" would have made it seem like much less of an imposition.\n\nBugged by the whole let-down, my husband called to report our observations about the storied Arizona Biltmore. The manager on duty politely listened and offered a free upgrade for our next stay. Unfortunately, I doubt he -- or we -- will get that opportunity.",0
It's a novel  idea BUT - burgers are not good. Tastes a bit like canned meat. I adore burgers (as you'll see if you look at my other reviews ). You pay for water (bottled) and I complained that my burger was cold - server apologised then didn't take it off the bill. Guess she wasn't bothered.  I wouldn't return to this place. Save yourself $6 and go to in n out. A much much better burger.,0
"I like this gym. It's nicer than some of the other gyms I've been to, and it's priced right at $22/month. But I think the real test of how awesome a gym is really comes down to \""""how long do I have to wait to use a machine at 6pm?\"""" because that's when this place is packed. Honestly, there are times where 6pm at LVAC feels like a nightmare: the locker rooms get packed, you have to wait like 10 minutes to use a machine, and parking is a hassle. But those horrible days (usually Monday - Wednesday) are not as big a deal for me because I prefer going on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturday and Sunday which seem to be less busy days. \n\nThey also have a little snack counter that is delicious, albeit too expensive to frequent all the time. The other day I had a turkey sandwich, a banana, some chips, and a water for $8. (Now my after-gym treat on some days is the peppercorn steak at Applebee's across the street for $10!)\n\nI do have one gripe about the gym: I always feel like the track portion of it should be cooler. It feels like there's insufficient air flow. At the same time, that may just be me complaining on account of I'm big.",1
"Really glad I got introduced to this place, I don't even mind it's a chain.\nPortions are very large, but you do pay for them. Got to try the baby back ribs and the brisket. Definitely the best ribs I have had-but what do I know, I'm from California.\nBrisket was moist and the sauce was well balanced. I tend to get overwhelmed by bbq sauce but this one was really good.\n\nDining buddy got the burger so I got to try it. Was actually tasty, especially the bacon. This might be a good option for people who would order a burger in a bbq joint; it will definitely taste like it was cooked on a grill (yes that's how they are supposed to taste).\n\nThe sides I had were mac and cheese and a baked potato. Mac and Cheese was creamy, baked potato wasn't stellar (then again when are they?)\n\nStrawberry lemonade was perfect! There's also a mixed drink that's a hurricane that will have you feeling good after only one.\n\nService was good up until the very end when we were waiting for a slice of cake to go that never came. Definitely a must if you are in Henderson. Actually, a must for anyone in Vegas.",1
"We live right by this park and I LOVE it, except for one MAJOR issue. We've seen the splash pad, used the dog park, walked around on the trails, seen the softball games and concerts, etc. That's all great. The park is clean, well lit, well maintained, and in a great location.\nBut WHO was responsible for the decision to put the lake right next to the playground and splash pad with NO fencing or barrier between the two? It wouldn't take much at all for a small child to wander away from the pavillions or the splash pad and fall in the water. Yes, kids are supervised but we all know that no parent can be everywhere all the time. I have a difficult time believing that no one thought of this during the planning and blueprint process. It would have been relatively easy to fix with either a barrier or a redesign of the park's layout. I'm afraid it will take a tragedy before anything is done about this.",1
"I really, really want to like this place. The food is decent, the space is pretty and the service has always been good. I just can't get past the client\u00e8le. It is in the PV Mall area, and for some reason it draws a kind of rough and tumble crowd. And they bring their kids. Ugh. Which is kind of weird to me since Z Tejas is literally just down the street and has a completely different vibe. Oh well. Can a restaurant control that? Maybe I am being unfair. Anyway, about a month ago, we stopped in  on a Sunday afternoon around 2:30 and had a great experience. Probably because no one was there, ha ha. We were offered the lunch menu and I had a fantastic lunch bowl with machaca. So, I signed up with Groupon recently and purchased a coupon for $20 for $40 worth of food so we decided to go back. Since we didn't want to jinx it we went back on Sunday...at 2:30. There were a few folks there, but it was relatively quiet. We sit at the bar and the bartender hands us the dinner menu. Hmmm. Maybe they changed policy on lunch hours?  Normally I would ask for the lunch menu but I am using a coupon so don't want to appear to be too cheap. Got my Sangria, yum, and perused the menu. Directly behind us, something funky is going on. There's a chick harassing a couple of tough looking dudes and a waiter comes over and talks to her about her \""""language\"""". Sigh. I did not hear much of what was going on...is she panhandling?! I try not to make eye contact in case she sets her sights on us.  Anyway, Bus Stop Betty finally moves on and calmness prevails. Back to the menu. The old man and I decide to order the same thing since I could not get him to change his mind; he can be so stubborn! We chose the Carne Asada with Jalapeno Bacon Wrapped Shrimp plate. It comes with a choice of sauce: sweet chili tamarind, prickly pear or mole! I love love love mole! I am so happy, because the other two are probably going to be too sweet for me. Just before the order comes out, our  bartender informs me that they are out of mole so he is giving me both of the other sauces. Seriously? Tell me that at the beginning! I would have ordered something else! As expected, sauces were way too sweet. Yuk. And how does a Mexican restaurant run out of mole? Not a good sign. Anyway, food was okay, but stuck using salsa. Also, thought that price was a bit on the steep side ($17) for two shrimp and way overcooked  (I ordered rare...it was well done) Carne Asada which is what...flank steak?! Walked out thinking doubtful I will ever come back. Sorry. I tried.",0
"Update: 6/20.\n\nI thought I'd give the impasta another try.  We had a guest from out of town, and thought we'd go out rather than spend the night in the kitchen.\n\nAs we went to our seats, we noticed an overabundance of drinking, and little eating.  As we scooted into our booth, the ladies next to us had to bowls of pasta that, for lack of a better description, looked dead.  They were lifeless, unappealing and bland.\n\nSo, we sat, looked over the menu, talked about drinks and wine, and sat.\n\nTwenty minutes later, we decide to get up, even though several people had looked our way.  No bread, no water, no hello, nothing.\n\nAs we left, we were stopped.  However, too little, too late.  We won't be back.",0
"Wouldn't recommend these guys based on my experience.  I reserved online one morning to pick up in the afternoon, but was told when I called an hour ahead of my pickup that there wouldn't be any cars available for six hours after my pickup time.  They weren't apologetic at all and didn't offer any kind of discount until I demanded one.  I don't think it's necessarily the fault of the guys at this location; car rental firms are just really poorly run.\n\n(There are better rental places in the area.  Wound up getting a car at a slightly better rate from a nearby Enterprise.  ...And I was able to pick up within an hour of reserving.)",0
"Clean, friendly, no long lines!",1
"Asian fast food and lots of it. It was intresting, just not something I want or crave. The kids love it, its fast and convenient. No frills, nothing memorable,  it is what it is.",0
friendly staff and some good rolls. Not my favorite place in the greater Phoenix area but definitely up there. Hiro gets pretty busy on the weekends so making a reservation is recommended.,1
"I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked in but if it's been around for 20 something years? or so I thought to myself it has it has to be good? It was a Sunday morning and there a bunch of open tables. We were told to pick a table so we did. After that it took a good 20 minutes before the lady came back to get our order and I was a bit annoyed because other tables who came in after us was getting their order taken. However, they had a different server so I'm not sure why our server was slow. \n\nWe ordered and the kids menu is very minimal. I ordered the original corned beef and hash with over medium eggs. My eggs came out sunny side up and runny all over the place. My corned beef hash was like burnt hash browns. The flavor was lacking and it was just overly crispy except for my eggs. On the plus side she asked if I wanted all of the peppers and onions and she was able to omit those. \n\nOverall I did not enjoy the food at all. Cool that they have homemade jelly but it didn't balance out that I had burnt food. Service was mediocre at best but it is what it is. I definitely would not come back when there are so many other breakfast places that are awesome.",0
"My wife and I attempted to eat at the diner at 11am on a Sunday and the best part of the visit was the parking spot, which was quickly ruined by my wife stepping in dog poop.\n  We grabbed the only available 2 person table, which had yet to be bused.  The frazzled 20-something server came over, apologized for the table and NEVER CAME BACK.  After 30 minutes of watching her frantically running around, people leaving and another \""""server\"""" bringing out food one plate at a time, we decided to leave.\n  I'm still a bit upset that we didn't get to try the food, which seems to get good/great reviews.  But whadda ya gonna do?",0
Fabulous for beer.  Plenty of space.  Board games.  Huge TV.  Just don't eat here - food was awful.,1
"Out after a Friday baseball game with another couple, we were loaded up quite well and the ladies decided Amsterdam was the logical place to go. Of course -- Cooperstown, Dbacks, Amsterdam! Being in my fan gear (Sedona Red jersey and slip ons), I was somewhat hesitant about not being 'hip' to their 'vibe' at Amerstam. Then Jenny reminded me that Charlies had charged her a cover but let me in for free, so I was sold.\n\nWe arrived about 9pm and the doorman was very friendly, asking about the game and checking our IDs. We spent most of our visit on the spacious patio having drinks until hitting the dance floor and leaving. As others have mentioned, they seem to not stock some typical ingredients (we had a round of white russians with soy milk) but, as an adult, I'd use this as an opportunity to try a different take on a favorite or something new altogether (we had absinthe -- it was gross and I felt like crap the next day).",1
"I have to say we were disappointed.  We found out they had a thin crust pizza, and we were \""""yes!\"""".  But the thin cheese pizza (which, in my opinion, is the best way to judge dough and sauce) had no flavor.  Really, you only tasted cheese.  Sauce had absolutely no flavor, and the dough was dough--brought nothing to the flavor of the pizza.  Now, I'll definitely say that a lot of people had stuff on their pizza--and perhaps that's how you're supposed order at this restaurant.  But a good pizza should stand on its own, and this one really didn't.  We had to add Oregano, parmesan, and salt just to give the pizza some flavor.\nWe had the Calamari--they were strips rather than rings.  They were deep fried with a heavy batter, and the oil was likely old.  The batter came dark, the marinara was too thick, and the calamari itself tasted old.",0
"Word of mouth!  That is the secret to finding this honest and competent mechanic.  I brought my car here for a second opinion on some recommended repairs that another shop wanted me to do.  And after looking under the hood, the recommended repairs was just the routine minor service plus replacing the hoses (reasonable given the age of the vehicle).  The cost of repair was reasonable, and the overall bill was hundreds less than what the competitor wanted me to pay.  \n\nThis shop may not be well known on Yelp, but the 3-4 times that I have been here over the past year, the place is always busy.  Most of the customers are Japanese, as the mechanic is from Japan, and really knows his Japanese cars.\n\nHonesty, reasonable quotes and competent mechanic skills are reasons why you should check out this mechanic.",1
The MUSHROOM CREAM SOUP saved me many times during late nights!,1
"SUCKED/HORRIBLE/WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!     I placed a order It took a hour te get my meal and when i received it my frys were still frozen when served, my sub had hardly anything in it, a slice of meat and hard melted cheese. The wings sucked. I spent 40 bucks there. I would have been better off going to subway and long wongs then this crappy place. When I complained there was no correction for what was served. Never go there. This place is HORRIBLE!!!!",0
"Love the lamb tocos and the sangria here. The patio is awesome. Margaritas are not half bad either! The chips are great, and the guac is delicious when it's not too salty.",1
"I really want to like this place as the hair dresser was so nice and friendly - but the hair cut I got here was so far away from being chic that I got another haircut to fix the one I got here. I wanted a cute pixie haircut that was feminine yet a little unkempt, that would provide some volume and be easy to style. But the hair dresser pretty much just chopped it off a little over the shoulders, put a little gel in it, and sent me out with my hair wet so it would air dry. I thought it was bizarre to say the least, and when my hair was dry and this super cool hair cut had failed to appear I just felt ripped off. Granted, he only charged me $30 or which I tipped $10 so a total of $40 - but that really wasn't a bargain because it just looked drab and boring and was still sticking to my neck in the muggy Montreal summer heat. \nAlso when we were discussing hair cuts and salons in Montreal I said I had gone to Pure before and he totally dissed them and said they cut angled cuts like Victoria Beckham. Thing is, she has long hair. VB had those angled hair cuts years ago. Shouldn't a hip stylist keep up with trends just a little bit?? Besides, shouldn't he cut whatever the client wants him to cut? I didn't exactly want a VB haircut but is the only alternative cutting it off straight at the shoulders? Seriously I am perplexed - how can this salon be on the Best of Montreal list? They must have bribed people to get on it. :(",0
"Dropped in with my expired Groupon.  Basically used my Groupon as a credit which they were happy to do.  Got waxed and must say was one if the best waxing experiences ever, great job and she took her time will definitely use her from now on.  Then pedicure... Awesome pedicure.  The while experience felt relaxing, not rushed at all.",1
Customer service is par but their service center needs work really bad. I had a flat replaced on my VN800 so I figured get both tires replaced. The girl that put my tires on took 2 hours for the front tire because she balanced it backwards when there is a sign on the tire pointing in the direction on which way its suppose to spine. Not to mention with in a month the valve stem broke here I am 6 months after install and it breaks again. Seriously even if it has to be ordered let someone else do the work.,0

"Great service and amaaaazing burgers! The taste and combinations are spot on! \nI had the Ronin burger and I became it's master! Nom Nom nom!\nMy friends got the Kiki burger and loved it!\n\nThe meat is soooo tender and melts in your mouth, the perfectly toasted sweet buns and tasty aoli's are the perfect match for these fusion burgers!\n\nCan't wait to come back, will defiantly be a stop before going back to LA anytime I'm in Vegas",1
"I'm from San Diego, CA, so I pretty much grew up with Mexican food. Taco shops were ubiquitous in my 'hood. Taco Bell and Tex-Mex? Flour tortillas and ground beef? No thank you, sir. So Chronic Taco reminds me of those taco shops that weren't that good, but you went because you were desperate and broke. And they always left you with belly full of grease. That's what Chronic reminds me of. \n\nBehind the faux-cool interior decor that includes graffiti tagged walls, Chronic cannot serve decent food consistently. I work nearby, so I know what's up. I think. At times, the food is good. But the next day can be downright gross. Their chicken tacos left me nauseated. I like their vegetarian and potato taco the best. The potato taco is probably the most interesting item in my opinion, it's like a mashed potato taco that is deep fried. Blasphemy right? It's actually tasty (in moderation, of course!) . But their veggie and potato tacos aren't good enough to visit every week. Next time, I'm sticking to Los Tacos.",0
"I arrived on a Thursday afternoon at 5pm when there was absolutely no other soul in the bakery (except for the staff). My pumpkin pastry with carmel topping was alright. I also tried the key lime cake and sour cream and apple cake. The key lime cake was definitely the best of the three.\n\nWhile I've been to better bakeries, I will definitely be back. I have heard stories of wonder and delight from other friends.\n\nThere is a small seating area with tables and a water dispenser for diners.",0
"I don't want to say one star, because some of the food (that I was lucky to get to) was good! Those running the trucks were all kind and friendly! The idea is fun! But this did not work.  It was over crowded, wrong area and wrong layout.  I would imagine a grassy area that the trucks could line up into a single line would work better, so the lines could stay more organized.  Grass for blankets and picnics. Limiting ticket sales should be considered, there was just too many people.  It felt stressful and dirty, we were trying to eat while standing in the next line.  The porta potties were too close to the trucks, they stank, and they were dark.  The water ran out from the hand washing station, thank goodness I stay stocked on disinfecting hand wet wipes. To top it off, the door failed and who knows how many people caught a peak at me hovering when someone opened the door to the one I was in. Yeah, I have a new embarrassing story to try and forget now...  But today, I can't forget because someones food isn't agreeing with us, and we have to stay close to our own clean, well lit bathrooms.   \n\nI had the goal to at least try to get a $65 meal worth of food for us, because that is what the tickets cost, but it didn't happen.  We ended up at Jersey Mikes after wards, just to get some food on our bellies.   \n\nThe good part, the ice cream from utterly delicious was soooooooooo good.  The sweet Caroline from epic hot dogs was very good. The hush puppy from the New Orleans style truck was very good.  The BBQ and coleslaw from the Piggy truck was very good.  The pork nachos were good, the cheese was sooooo good (this was the pink truck with a pretty blond on the front).  The creme brulee was yummy, no fancy steakhouse version, but still enjoyable.  \n\nThe frybread truck (on the far east side of the lot) wasn't good at all, the bread was doughy and had no flavor.  The lumpia from Hey Joe wasn't good either.",0
loved this place! went during a vacation with my boyfriend .. girl was really sweet . try the p90! freakin' amazing,1
"Always an interesting selection of fiction. Not an overly large selection, but it seems to rotate with regularity, and you won't have trouble finding some interesting titles and authors. \n\nCool setup, kind of has a retro vibe thing going on. And there are cats walking all over the place. \n\nThere is a mix of new and used on the shelves. The used prices are a little steeper than some of the other used book stores in Pittsburgh.",1
very avg lik most other indian restaurant !! though its decent compared to the price (9 bucks buffet )!!,0
"this is supposed to be the \""""world's greatest handburgers\""""\ni wasn't pleased. \n\nso i came here thinking it was a sit down restaurant, and boy was i wrong. \nyou walk in through the doors, and wait in line. when it's your turn, you order. \nand ordering is a hassle. maybe i'm too asian to figure out how to freaking order a burger, but i thought it was a bit challenging. \nthen they give you a buzzer thingy that lights up. \nnow you have to find a place to sit. \nOH MY GOSH, what a pain! you have to stake out a table and try to anticipate who's going to be done with their meal first and jump on it. \nwhen your food is ready, you go up to get it, and then you have to put your own lettece and tomato on it. [it's kinda like a buffet line] i give them extra kudos for making sure it was fresh, because the veggies DID look very very very fresh. \nthen you finally sit down and get to eat. not in peace though, because others are waiting for your table. \n\ni ended up paying $10 for a 1/3lb burger and wedges. they charged me extra for my grilled onions and guac. \ni think it's WAYYYYY overpriced for all the hassle i had to go through. you don't even pay that much at a sit down restaurant. \n\nyeah, the burgers were good, i guess. but i would never go back. \nmight as well go to IN-n-OUT and enjoy my meal for under $5 [which includes a drink]",0
"This was my first ATV free roam trip at the Nellis Dunes location, and it was so much fun!!!!!!!!  3 riders, 2 hour, at 125 per person.   I felt that was the best 125 i've spent at Vegas.\n\nNellis dunes offers steep hills,  ATV/Dirt Bike \""""park\"""" with large bankings, sand dunes.

"I do not understand these reviews at all. I went to Roberto's one evening for a burrito and some tacos. This place being from LA, already impressed me as I walked in the door. The second that I got in and paid my fee, my opinion changed. I cannot believe that they charge over $6 for two tacos, which were not only NOT fresh, but the tortilla was burned, the sour cream tasted terrible, and the beans were burnt. The meat tasted horrid, even worse than ground meat bought at some bad supermarket, and I don't even think it was steak. I don't understand why people rave about this place - it is strongly disappointing. I can't wait for another taco company or truck to come out with real Mexican food, fresh ingredients, and actual tacos that are worth their price. I wanted to make sure that it wasn't just this location so I went to the one on Harmon across from uNLV too and it was even worse. I've definitely had better, and while I understand that some businesses can stay in business due to the hype, this is definitely NOT authentic Mexican food. Instead it is a place that has cut corners and used poor quality food.",0
"Good southern food, especially by Vegas standards. Awesome ambience and friendly service. Prices are great and even better during happy hour (goes till 7:30). Half price appetizers! I especially recommend the oysters. Half dozen starting only at $4! Hear they have live music on the weekends. Will be back to check it out.",1
"Door guy was best member on entire staff!  We walked in, sat on patio, cocktail waitresses ignored every single person on patio, we finally went to bar to order a drink.  When at bar we saw a manager talk to the waitresses and tell them to quit chatting with each other and help the customers, we had already gone to bar so did not need them then (of course they didn't return when we could've used another round).  We then went to bar for another round and the bartenders did same as waitresses.  After a 15 minute wait to be acknowledged, mind you it was dead on Sunday evening, a bartender finally helped us.  We asked to speak with a manager just to let him know how terrible service had been, the manager came out and said you are drinking so I won't talk to you and he just walked away.  This place is the \""""jersey shore\"""" of Scottsdale, don't waist you time here.",0
Never said hello\nPity since the hats were nice \nTreated us poorly,0

"During a recent roadtrip to Pittsburgh our party of three found ourselves tired and ready for something delicious for dinner with the caveat that it had to be walking distance from our hotel. We consulted Yelp and decided to try out Lidia's for dinner. \n\nThe place is located on the fringes of the Strip and has nice clean feel to it. That's about as good as things got for me personally. The service was not very good. We were seated and ignored for about 15 minutes although the dining room was almost empty. A bread basket was placed on the table, but the bread was not very good. Once our waiter did come, (he looked like a Mafia Don) it took another 10 minutes to get our drinks. \nI ordered the grilled octopus on a bed of potatoes and an heirloom tomato salad, both appetizers, as my meal. The tomatoes were not ripe and unfortunately did not have enough acid of any kind on them so that flavor was quite bland. There was no salt or pepper on the table, and no pepper was offered either. The octopus was bland but quite tender and fresh.\n\nMy husband ordered the salmon which he thought was good but a bit overcooked overall -- nothing to write home about. \n\nThe third person in our party ordered the pork porter house which was very tasty.\n\nBased on fellow Yelpers we ordered the strawberry pannacotta for desert but unfortunately they had none at 7:30! We settled for cookies and a tiramisu. We left overall feeling disappointed in the service and the quality of the food.",0
"Fawk I wish I was in AZ at this moment. Pita is sooooo good! I enjoyed there Humans, they have several variations and all are good. This is a kick ass place to grab a great salad as well. Overall I enjoyed it to the max.",1
"Firefly never disappoints! Great food (stuffed dates, apple manchago salad and of course sangria are always a must-order) and even their olive and bread starter has that delicious sweet/tangy butter. Great for a first date or friends from work! Love the decor and the ambiance.  Service could be better, a couple times I've gone I felt like I waited forever for the server to come and ask if we wanted to order anything else.  And aside from all the negative comments and health history, I've always found Firefly to be delicious and I have full faith that they revamped their standards!",1
Horrible. The place reeks of smoke. The management at check-in and out do not care about their customers. They were rude and degrading to the point of being insulting. Resort fee is hidden and not worth it.,0
"First, I'm embarrassed that it look this long for me to write this review. To say that I love Nosh and Swig is an understatement. You can tell by each dish you try that the chef loves what he does and the entire staff is proud of what they are offering. And I've tried many of the dishes. It is a very easy going place almost like you've walked into the owners home for lunch or dinner. Sometimes all I want to do is kick back and this is my place to do just that. \n\nThey have figured out a way to have gourmet food at affordable pricing. They are also very good to the local music scene by having performers come in on Friday nights. We held an event there and they really went out of their way to make it perfect for us. They closed down the place, made room for our DJ and dancing. They allowed us to use their TVs at the bar. They printed personalized menus for my guests, create a special menu and helped by offering happy hour pricing at the bar. \n\nI don't think a lot of place you go out to is going to be perfect every time but at least I know that when I go to Nosh and Swig, they are trying to give me a nice dinning experience.",1
Steak Tartare was very good. Salads were weak. Seafood Platter was very weak. Need to improve.,0
The meat taste awesome!!! It's not as fancy but great place to eat!! I would definitely recommend this place to my family and friends,1
"VIBE\nIt's dirty. It's divey. It's steamies. What else do you expect? There is an impressive collection of Montreal maps on the wall. The servers look like they hate their jobs and everyone in the joint is drunk. There's a huge communal table in the back. Heaven.  I mean what more is there to love? \n\nI ATE \nSteamies. Duhh. La Traite was closed so we sauntered over here and wow, it did not disappoint! They put way too much onion/chopped cabbage on the dog but  for $1.35 what is there to complain about? Also, I'm curious as to the markup. If a pack of hot dogs is about $1.00 and they're charging you $1.35 per dog how much profit are they making? Why does this feel like Grade 7 math?\n\nPS they charge $1.95 at La Traite so what is the difference in profit margins there? \n\nOBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK \nHow did I never not know what a steamie was? Is this what I've been missing all of my life?",1
I moved to these apartments in June 2014 and it has been the worst experience for me!! \nI will not be renewing my lease next year at all!! \nSo they show you the models which are beautiful but then when you move in it's something else!! Nothing like the model house they show you!..  \nWe asked to not live where there are children who live above us! And guess what our upstairs neighbor has 3 kids!! Running around! \nAlso Maintenance sucks a week after I moved in in June the handle on my front door came of as we tried to open the door the handle flew off! We called maintenance and no one ever answered ..so we left a voice mail!.. I get a call back from the maintenance  guy and he said he would come around 12pm to fix the door!.. I was waiting and waiting!!.. No one ever showed up!.. \nIt's my 5th month living here.. I work late so I get home around 5 am the sun is out already! I wake up around 1pm to get my purse that I left in the backseat of my tinted car and someone broke the window of my car (I park my car there every night) supposably we have 24 hour security that drive around watching the apartments! I guess they just sit on there as\u015b all day driving there stupid golf carts!..  \nSo I call the office to report what happened.. and they told me the manager would call me back when she got back from a meeting.. We'll it's been about a week and no call yet!..  But they did call me 3 days later saying there was a noise complaint.. My downstairs neighbors said we were apparently using a chainsaw! (Really) \nIt's funny how they call me back about a noise complaint but they can call me back about what I wanted to report!.. \nHonestly if your looking for nice apartments in summerlin look somewhere else because these apartments suck!!!! They are a waste of money and time!..,0
"I'm a big fan of this new spot in the Mill Ave District. You order by filling in the extensive options on a paper bag which made it very easy to create the sandwich exactly how you want. This place can get very busy during the lunch hours; however, the ordering system allows the lines to move along fairly quick. I would recommend not getting the lettuce wrap option because it can be very messy. \n\n(Yelp check-in gets you a free bag of chips!)",1
"Avoid avoid avoid!! The gelato here is well....pretty bad. The flavors aren't that rich tasting and they do not have that smooth creamy flavor that gelato should have. Instead you are left with the feeling that you are having ice mixed with a little flavor and a little water. \n\nThe kiosk is located in a fabulous location at St. Marks Square within the Venetian Hotel and is a great place to get sit down and watch the people go by.......unfortunately the gelato tastes terrible!!! \n\nI would give this place one star, but I\""""ll upgrade it to two for the nice lady behind the counter and the wonderful location. All in all, save your money and go have gelato somewhere else....such as Francois Payard at Caesars Palace!",0
We stumbled into Paris Crepes on our way back to our B&B and it was one of the best desserts I had in Montreal. I had the crepe with strawberries and bananas (possibly raspberries as well) in some sort of light caramel sauce and my hubby had a crepe with Nutella (boring!). My beautiful fruit crepe was amazing and we owe a debt to the girl at the cash register because DH was considering one of the manufactured looking brownies and cakes and she warned him away and directed us towards the crepes which were way better and fresh! If only you were a country away :'( \nDefinitely go there and get yourself an amazing crepe from some very pleasant people!,1
Checking in was abit slow even though there was several receptionist standing there.  I think customer service class refresher will be beneficial for them. The place was nice and its very relaxing.  The lazy river was wonderful.  They need to stretch out their hours for convenience especially in the evening.  Checking out was a little inconvenience.  Gotta go all the way to front desk. At times there was no receptionist present on tower 5 bldg.,1
I just absolutely love coming here for my service. Stacey is an absolute joy!! and she answers any questions you may have. service is speedy. and making an appointment is always easy. :-),1
"Ate here twice last week. The first time there were three of us, good experience with very fresh food at lunch. We liked it so much, that we brought a party of 6 back for dinner. We were excited to show our guests the great items we had experienced previously. We ended up having a negative experience, with some of our guests saying they won't eat there again.\nOverall, the portions are truly too small, especially for a business that is just opening. A few of us ordered the full rotisserie chicken, which the waiter said served 4. They brought 5 tiny tortillas, a smattering of corn that did not cover the bottom of the dish and a small serving of beans that were undercooked and therefore hard, for four of us. When we asked for more tortillas, they brought us two, so we asked for more. We noticed when the bill arrived, they charged us $3.50 for the \""""extra\"""" tiny tortillas. \nWe ordered chips and guacamole before the meal and were brought a cereal bowl of chips, again for six people and a tiny side of salsa. We had two teenage boys with us, so the rest of the group chose to forego the chips so that they could eat.\nOur party of six was seated at one of the long tables in the center of the restaurant. Halfway through our meal, the waiter came over, told my son to move over on the seat bench and to pick up my purse, which was next to him, because they were going to sit two people AT OUR TABLE for dinner. The waiter didn't ask, just announced a party of two would be joining us. It was literally bizarre. The couple started heading over to our table and then refused to sit with us, as it was obvious that that would be totally weird.\nThe service was mediocre both visits. Hoping they really get this figured out as I would like to see a good restaurant succeed at the Shea 14 plaza. Start with generous portions, consistently fresh food, better service and go from there.",0
"Absolutely awesome horseback ride! Beautiful views great tour guide Jim and I can't not mention Rocky the tour dog. We took the last ride of the day and it was gorgeous. Went through water, saw the sun starting to set and just had a fantastic time. Oh and the two bald eagles and wild horses we came across were just another added amazing bonus! We will be back!",1
"So disappointing. All I can say is DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. It's as if they relied on the fact that it's MJ's music and they didn't have to do anything. The set designs had nothing to do with the music and the dancers were the worst I've seen in a show. Seriously, there are better street performers on the strip. There was little acrobatics and only some were good; most were old and boring. This isn't really a cirque show and MJ would be pissed at such a horrible show set to his music! I even think they had plants in the audience to get people to applause. Just don't go!  Go see Love at Mirage.....it was incredible!",0
"Very friendly staff, they really go above and beyond. They are always make me feel welcome. My favorite place to buy music books and instruments in las Vegas.",1
"Well, I have to write an updated review. Not sure if they changed hands since my original review, but their yogurt has certainly improved. The flavor selection is still kinda' limited, and I'd love a good SF option, but the texture and flavors overall are much better! Love the text alerts too! The salted caramel is delicious! I love it!! Sign up as a pro-swirler on their website for a discount!\nThanks!!",1
"I had heard a lot of hype about this place, but it was overpriced and the meatballs are better at subway. This place is gross and I won't be back, ever!",0
"So obviously anyone who has moved to a different state obviously know how hard it can be to find all the right companies to help you with your job. We booked this place through movinghelpers.com (I think it was) and the number they gave us to call would NEVER work. We could not get through to these people for the life of us.  When we finally were able to schedule something, even the receptionist said others were having the same issues reaching them. I get a call about a week later saying they will not service us because they do NOT want a bad review (the online site has us review companies after they provided service). I guess figuring the communication issues they didn't want to risk their good score. But who knows how many others had the same thing happen. The girl was rude and aggressive on the phone when I was trying to explain we could not reach them, and didn't seem to want to hear what I had to say. Anyway, I wouldn't trust these people. I was anxious to leave a yelp review but disappointed they didn't have a Yelp yet. Either way, they still got their bad review.",0
i love this place. there's so much i want to try (like the suicide squeeze pictured up there)...but i always seem to stick to the first thing i ever ordered and love...the razzle dazzle.,1
"Yep, still sucks.  Had to stay here for work, not by choice.\n\nThe beds are stiff and generally uncomfortable.  The heating/cooling unit turns on often at any temperature.  It is best to shut it off to sleep since it is extremely noisy.  The television is older than me.\n\nThe casino area reeks of smoke.  They need to invest in some higher volume air cleaners.  Just walking to the elevators will require you to burn your clothes to get the odor off.\n\nThere are no decent food options.\n\nLastly, they were hosting a cheerleading competition for young kids.  Two things; what casino would host this type of event, what organization representing children would choose a casino?  As a casino you annoy and disturb all your other visitors.  Nothing says family like gambling, booze and smoke.  Great parenting.",0
"Lissen up folks!\n\nYou're really not going to get much better than this Las Palmas location. \n\nThe prices are extremely good, the taco stand is awesome, and they have a full deli. I am not aware of any other full service grocerias in Pittsburgh. The selection is quite complete - you can get anything from a selection of dried chilis to Salvadorian crema, and the produce is well priced as well!\n\nThere's even a full cooler if you want to buy some agua con gas or Jarritos!\n\nWhen I need to find real ingredients (they also regularly carry fresh cactus paddles..) this is the true stop in da burgh.",1

"We \""""lived\"""" in Vegas temporarily over the summer and visited Rock & Roll Kids with a friend whose kids regularly attend.  My 3 1/2 year old loved it so much and talked about it (and Mr. Jon) so enthusiastically over our first weekend there that I decided to enroll him for the remainder of our stay. Over our couple of weeks there I quickly learned that ALL of the kids, parents and grandparents adore Mr. Jon, and it's easy to see why. He's phenomenal with kids of all ages. (Even my 8 1/2 year old looked forward to going with us each day, even though he mostly watched with me from the sidelines.) As a former Kinder teacher, the structure of his class instantly impressed me, too. Not everyone can engage, entertain and teach pre-k kids for an hour, but his classes have the perfect balance of developmentally appropriate play and learning activities that have physical, social and educational lessons all tied together. \n\nWe honestly can't say enough good things about Mr. Jon and Rock and Roll Kids!! I feel blessed that my boys got to have such an awesome experience with such a terrific teacher and role-model!",1
"Tried Prommare's a few weeks ago and it's my new go-to for Thai food.  It's the best I've had in town and is always consistently good.  The lunch specials are cheap with very large portions.  My favorite is the Kang Ped (red curry) and Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles)... highly recommend them, but everything I have tried is delicious.  I enjoy eating in but expect it to take around 45 minutes because it's always crowded!",1
"Let's just start by saying that anything that is considered \""""Fashionable\"""" always seems to have an element of questionable functionality.  \n\nBiltmore Fashion Park is just that - a fashionable park in the biltmore area.  With upscale retail stores and pricey boutiques, it is just the right blend to make us 99% feel fashionable.  After valet parking, we can pick up our new Apple products, walk around the park swinging our sleek bag and then stop for a drink on the patio of one of the upscale dining options.  Even bring our canine accessory for the day and watch movies in the evening.\n\nI love it! The restaurants are awesome (even if Sam Fox has a stranglehold on most of it now), but Christopher's Crush Lounge is not to be forgotten in the back corner either.  When they have movies in the park, definitely get there early for a great lawn seat.\n\nParking is a bit of a nightmare, but avoid the south side completely for a more pleasant experience.  Going in the \""""back way\"""" is a much better option although less visually appealing.\n\nThe Biltmore Fashion Park has been an institution at this corner - hosting the likes of Planet Hollywood, Coffee Plantation, Sharper Image, and many other greats of their time.  Glad to see it is still around and kicking!",1
"Yum, yum, yum.  You Charlotteans really need to check out this Eritrean / Ethiopian establishment. \n\nThe taste level is above what I've experienced at the Meskerem's of the world, and you're definitely in for more of an authentic experience, with real teff injera and more varied menu options such as the tartars.  \n\nI went with the avocado salad and veggie platter.  Taste level was outstanding for both -- 5/5.  Perfectly cooked, fresh vegetables and the injera was perfect for me...not too sour with a touch of sponginess.\n\nThe owner is super nice, and really goes out of his way to make sure you're happy.  I get the sense that it's literally a mom & pop shop.  He even offered me an extra helping of my favorite part of the veggie combo (happened to be the spicy chickpeas).  All I can say is double yum.  :)\n\nWhy is this not a 4?  Plastic over the tables, a 90\"""" tv showing football matches, and the hookah bar next door detract from the restaurant experience for me.  I'd recommend they go full-on food, because they're that good but apparently they're trying to do the bar thing too which is disappointing but very African-restaurant-esque sadly.",1
"Worth the 8 minute detour from the interstate of you are looking for a brunch time meal away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip.\n\nThere is something about places that beg me to leave a good review on Yelp!. Bus boys wear t-shirts that say \""""Help us...Yelp! us.\"""" A sign hangs in the window advertising that people like them on Yelp!. Then,  at the end of your meal,  a 20 question survey is handed to you with another Help Us,  Yelp! us advertisement.  I don't need your constant reminders to leave a good review, just quality service and great food. Also,  if you want me to leave a review,  provide me with free wifi since your network shows up as the strongest of the many networks in the area (3 of which are free).\n\nThat said,  we received quality service and great food.  My fianc\u00e9 and I shared their Country fried steak and eggs,  hashbrowns, biscuit,  and a side of corn beef hash. The steak was prepared in a great batter;  very crispy,  not hard,  thick,  but not overwhelming.  Gravy was served on the side and was very tasty.  Hash Browns are more like a mix between hash browns and home fries... home fried hash browns, maybe? The fluffy and crispy biscuit came out late,  but it was topped with sausage gravy at no charge... nice! Also,  the corned beef hash was a very good addition to this meal. We left very full and ready for a nap,  to bad we have a 4.5 hour drive ahead of us. \n\nThe food was matched with great service from the time we signed in to paying the bill.  Good job,  now lose the Help Us, Yelp! Us shirts, it's tacky and unnecessary given the quality food and service you have. You'd receive 5 stars if you didn't have the Yelp! requests everywhere.",1
What a big disappointment.  The restaurant has the atmosphere of a McDonalds and besides the Chinese lanters overhead has no Asian flavor whatsoever.  Appetizers arrived before main courses and the food was mediocre at best.  I was positive that I'd been here 2-3 years ago and I'm sure I was at some version of the restaurant then but it looks like it moved and is now located in an annex of the cafe next door.  Funny how a bad atmosphere can make a meal feel cheap and that's what's happening at Mandalay Bay's Noodle Shop.,0

"I adore Korean food, This was my least favorite. For a new restaurant it was dingy and used looking.  Very sparse. The menu was deposited on the table, no drinks were offered only a lukewarm water glass.  We ordered the combo, chose the spicy pork bulgogi, and the short ribs.  What a disappointment. We always patron Takamatsu's but decided to try this as it was new and the ratings were good.  If you are not Korean, the  portions are pathetic, for 21.99 we were given what I would expect as a meager lunch portion.  I noticed that others that ordered the same dishes were given much larger portions, and also given much more personal attention.  We stated that it was our first time, but it made no difference.  What a shame as when we love a restaurant we spread the word.  The same is true for when we do not like a restaurant  only we tell more people.",0
"How I love this place! My fianc\u00e9 and I have been coming here for years and I am just writing this review.

"While the food wasn't bad...but not real good either, their drinks were VERY weak, probably because it was happy hour.

Tasted like we were just drinking Margarita mix and fruit punch.",0
This place is beyond amazing!- if you are looking for a good breakfast this is the place to go In Vegas! Lobster Egg Benedict was very delicious. For a little dessert we ordered the Almond croissant. It is so buttery and delicious. I made a reservation via yelp and thank goodness I did this place is always packed and the usually wait time can be anywhere from 45min to 1hr. We had reservations both times and we still had to wait. Well worth it...,1
"horrible service and food.  i placed a delivery order and was told it would take 30 minutes.  it took almost 2 HOURS to get my food!!  ridiculous.  what if i wasn't going to work that late and i had paid for it already?  when i called to see where my food was, i got a litany of excuses about them being backed up, lost driver (delivery was going downtown - not complicated), etc., etc.  uuuh, not my problem.  you're running the business, remember?  you're supposed to do what it takes to deliver on all levels - e.g. hire more staff, get knowledgeable drivers, get a GPS.  i pay you to make and bring the food in the time stated, period.  if they were a little late, no problem, but 2 hours is UNACCEPTABLE!\n\nof course, by the time i got the food, it wasn't hot, wasn't good, and certainly wasn't worth all the trouble.  when i made a big stink about it, they offered me a deal the NEXT time i ordered.  yeah, as if i'm going to go there again.",0
"Love going here during the summer.  Nice bar outside and great people and boat watching.  Went here for dinner last week and it was just Meh.  Food was bland an uninspired.  What the waitress offered as the special was not what was delivered.  After we asked, she still didn't know what was included with the dinner.  Walleye sandwich was just OK.  Service was on the slow side too; one server for the entire 2 floors.  The lady tried hard, so she earned a good tip.  The kitchen and management could do a lot better.  Probably will not go here again for dinner.  Too bad because we do like the place overall.",0
Any bakery that is by appointment only should not have a huge marquee and have posted on there doors that it is appointment only.  And then when you walk in look around confuse a man with a box of raw meat shouldn't treat you like a hobo looking for a place to squat,0
"I always enjoy visiting at this Theater, it is always clean, neat and well maintained.\nPicture quality and sound are very good, but on a few occasions, the previews had no sound, that kind of sucks hence 4 stars and not 5.\nTypical way overpriced snack bar with no healthy choices, but of course this is the industry standard, however the snack bar is very clean and well maintained and I don't fear eating anything here.\nI go to this Harkins over the SanTan location on Greenfield primarily because it isn't near as busy. One time, went to San Tan and couldn't get a ticket, sold out, drove over to Crossroads and got in for the same viewing time at only 40% occupancy.\nThis is my theater of choice.\nA few more visits with no sound issues and I will change to 5 stars.....\nWell, many movies later, this place is 5 stars all the way...\nMy one bid complaint though is women that bring in strollers and allow their baby to cry through the entire movie. It ruins the experience, but at least the theater gives a free movie pass each time to make up for it.\nCan't blame the theater for inconsiderate idiots.....",1
No good..sorry Kneaders..you'll never be Paradise Bakery. Our first visit was so bad and the sandwiches were awful that they gave us two free sandwiches for our next visit and those were just as bad....service is also poor. Save yourself time and stick with a classic like Paradise Bakery or Flancers. (Heck.. save yourself a ton of money and just go to Subway in the same shopping center as the quality is about the same). Kneaders sandwiches are all bread..no meat.,0
Taste really BAD.... Maybe my expectation for a 4.5 star icecream shop was too high. It kills your appetite for real icecream.  Don't recommend for anyone who wants a good taste icecream.,0
"This place was bizarre to say the least and I don't mean that in a good way.  5 of us stop in for dinner Sunday night.   Wait unusually long time for waitress although she apologized.  Decide it was best to order food and dinner at the same time considering how long it took us to get a menu.   We don't get any drinks but she shows up with two baskets of fries.  She then brings our burgers with 2 on one plate.  Never knew I had to share my plate.   Drinks finally show up, very few water refills and my salad never arrives... Out of onion rings.  Wouldn't recommend and wouldn't ever go back!",0
"I've been to this Harley shop 3 times now.  The location isn't too bad, it's on the south side of the \""""main\"""" part of the strip, so there isn't quite as much traffic along Las Vegas Blvd as in other parts.  But, as John F. said, it can be a little tricky crossing the Blvd when going in and out.  But, it hasn't been too bad for me.\n\nAesthetically, this place looks good, even though there are a few areas under minor construction to finish up the place.\n\nI have bought clothing items there, and the staff has been extremely helpful to me every time I've browsed through the shop.  One girl in particular, Ginni, went out of her way to help me out, even looking through their stuff in the back to double check for similar styles in the sizes I need.  They seem to stock a lot of XXL items, so if you're looking for M or L, then can be in somewhat short supply of certain items.  \n\nI have also had my bike serviced at this location.  The staff there was quite helpful, although, they seem to be a tad understaffed right now (a week after opening).  Whether that's due to increased foot traffic because of location, or because this is simply the newest shop, I can't say.  But, there did seem to be a little bit of a wait at the service department.  After the wait though, they were quite helpful and friendly to me when I ordered parts and again when I brought in and picked up my bike after they did the installation of what I ordered.  I would have liked there to have been less of a wait between when I ordered the parts and when they arrived.  But, I'm not sure that's something this particular store has much control over.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience at this location and highly recommend it.  However, I will probably do future business at the Red Rock Harley simply due to it's location.",1
"I hate to pull the \""""Noir Card\"""" card...but prepare yourself, because I'm about to.\n\nAs a Noir level MLife member, you come to expect good treatment from the hosts and staff at clubs in the MLife family.  Now, I understand that Light Group manages and runs the clubs - not the hotels themselves - but it's still a courtesy to have a little grace with the people who've spent a ridiculous (and I mean RIDICULOUS) amount of money at the casino in which they're located.  \n\nSome friends of mine were in Vegas and after getting a day bed at Daylight, we had a little disco nap, went to dinner, and headed over to Light.  The group was small - just 4 of us, even ratio - and after dropping some serious cash at the pool, we figured that getting into the club wouldn't be too big an issue, considering the SAME \""""manager\"""" was working the night club line.  We. Were. Mistaken.\n\nEven though I'm local, and even though I'm a Noir member, and even though we'd spent a grip of cash that day at the pool...he said \""""I'm sorry, but I'm still going to have to charge you a cover and have you wait in line.\""""\n\n...Really?

"I'm not ashamed to say I like the Kardashians and I am a huge reality TV show junkie. I spent all my free hours catching up on those shows. But why the disappointment?\n\nWell, during my recent Vegas trip, I found out Khloe Kardashian was making an appearance at the Kardashian Khaos. It was a no brainer I was going to stop by and see her beautiful face in person! Upon the day of the appearance, I walked eagerly over to the store located inside the Mirage Hotel & Casino, following the screams of girls. I found it and squeezed my way to the front to find Khloe standing inside the store taking pictures with fan. \n\nSo, I asked the security guy where the line to enter the store starts. His reply was shocking. \""""The line starts over there and it is $150 to go inside.\"""" \""""WAIT.. did you say $150? to go in the store??\"""" \""""well, Khloe is here but you can go in after 3PM without paying.\""""  AIN'T NOBODY PAYING $150 TO SEE KHLOE KARDASHIAN.

"Went on Friday night and nothing tasted very fresh. The bean dip, the beef, and the pork all had an off taste to them. The meat portions also were very dry like you would expect from old reheated food. Everything else was just okay. Makes you wonder if they bother tasting anything first. Definitely not worth the money spent on a family outing when there are many other choices available in the area (Yes even filibertos is much better than this).",0
"Ate two meals here, the breakfast buffet and dinner, and was happy with both. The service was a little slow for dinner, but they were all very pleasant and gave us our own little room off the back of the restaurant so we could be loud without bothering people. Drinks were decent for a hotel place but cost a little bit of money. Yeah expense account! :)",1
"BK is always my favorite fast food joint. Had lunch here before catching my flight to Denver.\n\nI ordered the BK Big Fish sandwich - with cheese and onions added. For some reason the BK Big Fish was not listed on the menu - so I asked first.\n\nThey had three cashiers working the line and they were moving it quickly. And the expediter was cranking out the food to hungry customers rapid-fire.\n\nThe sandwich must have just come out of the fryer, Hot, crisp, cheese was melted, and oh so damn tasty!",1
Multigrain pancakes are delicious (although I don't use the agave syrup I use organic maple at home lol) and the breakfast burrito is also delicious. Pretty much everything I've tried is great... Except jicama fries  I highly recommend and love this place!!,1

"I visited this shop a few months ago. Awesome clothes. I had only looked at clothes on their website and they have a much broader selection in the shop. As I was shopping, the snotty store manager seemed very annoyed that people wanted to try on their clothes before making purchases. I've worked retail as well and I get it's stressful when it's busy but it's just apart of the job. Probably wouldn't have a job if it weren't busy. She continued to be rude to me, my friends and the other patrons in the shop. When we got to the register, the girl wanted to make sure we found everything we were looking for, politely we said yes, and the line behind us was growing. When a second girl tried to open the other register, the store manager humiliated her by rudely telling her not to do this and she needed to count stock. And the stock was just tank tops on a table that there were plenty of. It surprised me that she would speak to the staff so harshly, especially when she was trying to get the patrons to make purchases. I hope she's decided that this is not the job for her and has parted. She was terrible.",0
"I've seen Maggianos in other cities, but this was my first time dining at one.  We decided to have our meal \""""family style\"""" which was recommend by my brother and his fiancee.   \n\nThe food was pretty good, in particular we enjoyed the mussels and loved  the Tiramisu.  Our server was excellent.  They also have some reasonably priced wines available.\n\nI've heard mixed things about this chain, but was pretty impressed with my visit.  Family style definitely seems to be the way to go when dining here.",1
"Won't be back! Went there for Breakfast and the place was only half full, and a zero wait on a Saturday Morning...You think we would be ecstatic right? NOT! Everything was downhill from this point. I noticed they were using wait staff to seat people and check people out, this is fine for a small mom & pop, but not for large chain restaurant. Where was the hostess and manager...no where to be seen, that's where. This should have been our first sign. After being seated, it took 10 minutes before they took our drink order. I had to ask twice for a spoon for my coffee. Probably the worst cup of coffee I have ever had. After placing our order, we waited 30 minutes, then decided to walk after noticing our food sitting under the heat lamp for god knows how long (while our so-called waiter was checking people out). Be warned...stay away.",0
"We stopped in for Happy Hour... We each had one drink, and the total was $17.  Thats happy hour price?  :-\\  My martini was pretty awesome, I'd come back for A drink... not a place I'd wanna drink all night...\n\nThey do have Absinthe.  We ordered one of the Lucid, and one of the Kublar.  The bartender gave it to us strait.... (definatly not the way to drink it! EW!)   She then told us that the Downtown cocktail room is one of the two ONLY places you can buy it in Vegas, and that we could buy a bottle there (to take home) for a mere $200 (i can't remember exactly.. it was around 200) ... So, we passed... as the shot of strait Absinthe was way too much to handle (maybe if it were served properly) \n\nLater the same day, we were over at another downtown bar ... which also had Absinthe (not one of the \""""two\"""" bars in Vegas that supposedly have it.... ) \n\nAlso, before we left, we noticed it @ one of the gift stores.

"Have to say up front, the fact that this place moved to a new venue is a blessing and a curse; on the one hand, the neighborhood it's in now is much safer (an important factor for people like me who have to walk back to a car alone in the dark after these shows), but it's now further away and parking can be harder to find. Life gives and takes, I suppose...\n\nNow, to the meat of this review: while my favorite place for cheap improv is actually Pittsburgh's Friday Nite Improv show, I'm still fairly fond of Steel City Improv Theater. Pittsburgh has an amazing improv scene overall, which I didn't actually realize until speaking to the folks here almost a year ago. Steel City stands out from the local crowd in part because of its emphasis on long-form improv (doing a longer, \""""themed\"""" comedy show, as opposed to what amounts to a three minute stand-up piece in short-form) and also because of the classes that it offers. Seriously, locals - if you're looking for a place that actually has classes for improv, this is the place to go; I've only ever heard good things about the classes, and a couple of my friends who took them have moved on to form their own comedy group.\n\nAlso, the people who work or volunteer here, and the people who come through performing, are all kind, polite, talented folks - an absolute joy to talk to and to watch, even if the shows don't go quite as well as we want them to. You can just tell that everyone is having a good time - the most important part of a comedy show!\n\nAll in all: can't say I've ever had a bad time when I've gone here, even if I'm not always a fan of \""""long-form improv.\"""" I say, look up some show times, schedule a dinner date and head here for some entertainment one night - you won't be disappointed. A note to parents: realize that these shows are performed by adults, for adults, so unless you want your kids repeating swear words all the way home, find a babysitter. Think of it as a great excuse for a date night.\n\nBy the way, bring a few bucks to pay for the tickets ($5) and for some cheap beverages (alcohol's available) and snacks.",1
"The Lunch Box; tasty.\n\nWalked in and Metallica, \""""Sad But True\"""" playing on the stereo.  Great way to start a meal.  D\u00e9cor is pretty minimalistic, I think this is intentional, but I personally prefer places with a more of a welcoming atmosphere.  But the style here serves its purpose for a turn and burn lunch counter.  I probably would have stayed for dessert if the environment was more pleasant. (note to owner: this cut my check average down 40%).  The owner is the only staff here, and he is very friendly.  He was very personable with me, but I was there before the lunch rush.  \n\nThe menu is very small, but more than expected for a hot dog joint.  The flavor combinations of each specialty hot dog sound enticing, I'm curious to try them all.  So I'll definitely be back.  I ordered the Tokyo Brat and it was great.  He was out of Daikon Radish, but it was still great, I think it would have upped the texture ante though.  The flavor components of the Tokyo Brat may sound intense for hot dog enthusiasts, but they are pleasantly subtle.\n\nThis small lunch counter can easily get to 5 stars in my book with just a few minor changes.  Their \""""Meal Deal\"""" only applies to the Chicago Dog, and I believe it should be offered for all their hot dogs.  I was disappointed when the people after me ordered and got their food for one-third less.  I felt I was being punished for ordering the Tokyo Dog.  Also, the hot dog bun lacked structure and flavor.  Because of the fragile bun, all of my delicious toppings kept falling off.  I don't mind the mess one bit, but it did not allow each bite to have condiment equilibrium.  \n\nThe Lunch Box is much better alternative to the douche-bag central known as the UNLV Student Union.  For any businesses in the area looking for a great place for a nice lunch break, this place should go on your list.",1

"Quick, call Guy Fieri!  You've lost your mojo!\n\nHad lunch there this noon.  Jerk chicken, egg foo young, chicken fried rice and refried beans.  The chicken was tasteless (I've been to Jamaica, so I know what it tastes like), and the egg foo young was warmed over with package gravy.  The fried rice was bland and the refried beans came from those big cans a Costco.  The portions used to be pretty good sized, but they've cut back on that too.  That and a drink was $10, way more than it should have cost.  Big, no, HUGE disappointment from the past.\n\nBottom line: bland, small portions, over priced.\n\nUnless I hear that the location was taken over by aliens today, I won't be back.",0
"As a music venue, the interior decor - classy lighting accents, wall & ceiling decorations, etc. - are simply beautiful and add wonderfully to the overall listening experience.  View from most of the seats are good and the acoustics are just right.  Plenty of nearby public parking throughout town as well.\n\nIronically, we prefer driving from Cleveland to see performances here in the Pittsburgh Cultural District rather than deal with the congested traffic, road conditions and construction, and cost of parking in downtown Cleveland!  Have and will continue to revisit this great hall!",1
"I needed a gift for my two-year anniversary, so I was definitely committed to purchasing. After some prodding from some female friends threatening me if I had chosen a gift from a lesser location, I naturally ended up here.\n\nService was very disappointing to say the least. I walked around by myself for about 15 minutes before anyone talked to me, which was fine, no gripe there. But the lady that ended up helping me was genuinely uninterested in assisting me find anything and mostly returned my questions with one-word answers or blank stares. She was definitely making me feel awkward, as if I didn't belong here, or just being generally impatient with my lack of jewelry knowledge. Maybe it's too much Vegas for her, too many tourists coming in asking to try on stuff, but I was ready to buy something and get out.\n\nI ended up picking out a sterling silver necklace with a Tiffany blue pendant something. I guess I was happy with the product. Service needs some work here.",0

The main dishes were too pricy for what you got. The cheapest price was 31$ for a plate of duo pasta. Look, I'm italian. I know my pasta. If I can eat my Cavatelli with a spoon because it turns into mush if I use my fork.. or if I need a chainsaw to get through my fettucini; we have a problem.\nOne waiter seemed to be quite update that evening, shaking a plate of salad in front of my face to get my attention (really?) or ripping a plate of soup away from a 7 year old because she was eating from the kids menu (you're joking right?).\nFor the price it cost, I would have MUCH rather eaten at Mc D's and then taken the rest of the $$ and gone shopping. \nHad I known, I would have never eaten my food and gone for a burger instead.",0

All of the units are old and I will steal this quote from a friend, they put lipstick on a pig and try to fool future residents. Though the rent is reasonable, they have lost my payment twice in the last few years. Not worth the hassle.

"The long walk from the parking garage is irritating, but the spectacular new building brightened my spirits. The plush chairs in the waiting area and the intro movie with my favorite newscasters (Kim and Dana Wagner!!) helped ease my anger over Ms head-to-toe Ed Hardy who couldn't figure out how to mute her cell phone game, and Mr douche who wanted to be my new best friend sitting next to me. \n\nThen the day got even better (or so I thought), they needed 2 juries, so the other 50 or so of us weren't needed. Then the announcement that we would all have to sit in the waiting room until judges called saying they were completely finished choosing those 2 said juries came... my heart sank. The reserve jury?!??! I don't get to go home, I don't get to go into a courtroom and answer cool questions - damnit this was the worst of both worlds. At 4:30 our jury waiting room host FINALLY called the judges and they dismissed us. Could she have called at 2 or 2:30 to get this information?  Probably, but what's another 2 hours for these 50 poor schmucks on the reserve jury. \n\nDespite my anger about being on the \""""reserve jury\"""", the overall experience wasn't all that bad.

"Went inside to look around for a dinner table, the prices were reasonable. There were other people in the store and about three sales people.

I guess they didn't want my business. I won't be going back there. Terrible customer service",0
"I've dined here 4 times in the last 12 months. Service and quality of food was consistently high each time. My last experience was 2/18. Our seats were back by the open kitchen.

The lamb entree and the pork ribs entree were the best of the four entree's we ordered...I called in reservations 10 minutes before our arrival. I was told that there were 2 open tables, but when I got there, there were no open tables. Our wait was 15 minutes (or one cocktail)",1
"After the last time of going to Cosmo and having my dog attacked by a dog who's owners couldn't control it, I didn't think I'd be back to the park (even though I had been plenty of times without incident) but I did go back this evening. \n\nI figured it had been about 6 months and I really do enjoy taking her. She loves it. I should have re-read my past review about telling myself I'd NEVER go back in the evenings. And here's why...\n\nTo be honest, I wasn't expecting anything bad to happen. My dog was having her usual fun time but within 5 minutes of entering, a small dog got attacked by a larger dog and all you could hear was crazy amounts of yelping and whining like the dog was being eaten. It was a horrible sound. The owner of the small dog started crying hysterically, running towards the dog, arms outstretched screaming like a banchee. Now, of course it's not her fault her dog is being attacked but she definitely was escalating the situation by acting this way. Don't any of these people watch The Dog Whisperer? Geez. :P Energy people. CALM, ASSERTIVE energy. Fuck, it's not hard.\n\nSo this fight between the two dogs is still going on. About 15 seconds into it, it turned into an all out brawl with 6 other dogs going ape-shit on this little dog and then each other. IAnd THEN, as if things couldn't get any worse...every dog in the park started running over to the scuffle. First thing I thought was, \""""It's time to get the FUCK OUTTA HERE!\"""" \n\nThe group of dog owners converged in the entry way to the park, apparently to talk out the situation, while hysterical lady kept crying. Some words were exchanged between owners & I decided it was time to excuse myself. Mind you, I had my dog leashed at this point. She was healing & completely under my voice command. I made her sit and stay at the gate, in front of all these people and their dogs. I went first and she followed, all on my voice commands. \n\nIt made me feel like I accomplished something to have my dog under my control while there was complete chaos ensuing around me. \n\nIf you can't even get control over your 10 lb. dog in most circumstances, please for the love of god, DON'T TAKE THEM TO THE DOG PARK. And if you don't have control of your 70 lb. dog, DON'T TAKE THEM TO THE DOG PARK.",0

"Breads and croissants are really good here. My favorite was the almond croissant- buttery, flaky, and rich with a hint of almond paste; perfect for breakfast with their coffee and/or tea.

"So incredibly pricey! For the price...not sure if it's worth it. Waiter was good and we were seated so that we could look at all the people shopping outside. Our order:\n\nCalamari: Gluten free whaaaaat? But yes, it is! Not super crispy, but definitely nice flavor though slightly bland. Sweet and sour sauce instead of traditional cocktail/marinara. Not bad.\n\nCaesar salad: Very fresh and crispy. For the price of $13 though? It really was a slab of romaine lettuce with dressing...\n\nRoasted chicken with BBQ sauce pizza: Bf did not like this at all. Sauce was lacking and chicken was dry. Pizza crust was dense, yet tried to be a thin crust...not crispy. Honestly, the flavor just tasted off to me.\n\nKurobuta pork schnitzel: Um, it was a dry pork cutlet mashed thin and fried. The whole grain mustard sauce was good, but $27 for a pork cutlet is just not acceptable. Do not get this! Looks plain and tastes like it too! My friend did not even bother to finish it and ate her bf's food instead.\n\nFree range chicken: Half a chicken over very smooth, slightly buttery potato puree. Veggies (brussel sprouts) were pretty good. the chicken was well seasoned and the natural au jus was flavorful as well, however some of the chicken was still dry. It is difficult to make moist chicken breast though, so I can't complain too much. \n\nOverall, for the price we are paying, I expected more. I'll come here if my friend wants to go again, but I probably would not come here on my own, especially considering that Venetian offers so many wonderful restaurants.",0
"I read the good reviews and a friend said it was good so I thought I would give it a try. I really liked the Thanksgiving Turkey wrap, it reminded of the traditional turkey feast.

For the $7.50, the salad was way too small and just didn't taste like a traditional \""""warm spinach salad\"""". Also, the mandarin oranges didn't really fit in this salad. Overall I probably wouldn't do back. Nothing special.",0
"A fun outdoor environment with a shabby surf shack atmosphere. When I first walked in the place seemed kind of run down. The sprawling grounds had us meandering all around the property and no one was greeting us so I wasn't sure if we were going to get very good service. \n\nAfter finding a table out of the wind a server greeted us and gave us a menu. We ordered beer, nachos and a fried ice cream. I wasn't expecting much, but it was all very good. \n\nThe setting was very pleasant with a view of a baseball field. Kids were playing volleyball and someone brought their dog. The music volume level was acceptable for the outdoor setting. \n\nThe padded bar stool seating was very comfortable.

"I'm not a fan of cheap haircuts. You get what you pay for. I NEVER get a \""""real\"""" haircut at any of these $10 places.

I take my 10 year old daughter to her and she's slowly fixing the awful haircut she got at another salon (I use that term loosely).

"I'm glad there's a new owner in this establishment because the last one was awful. We got the house rolls with spinach and feta and they were sooooo good! Then there was the extreme meat pizza, don't know if that's the exact name but everyone loved it. I got a veggie which was just ok. Had no really great flavor. Next time I want to try a different veggie one, they had 2. I will deffinatly go back and try more of the rolls. The menu was pretty big and I'd like to try a lot of different things they have.",1
"Stopped in for dinner around 7 on a Wednesday and it was very dead. I ordered the blue cheese burger after hearing that it is very similar to Tessaro's. The only similarity that it shares is that they are both grilled on a wood fired grill. The burger was unbelievably bland, the char grilling made the exterior very bitter, and the bun was rather tasteless. For my choice of side I went with fries. I was excited when they first arrived, they looked like they were going to be crunchy and delicious, unfortunately they were greasy and limp. The only positive aspect of the meal was our very friendly and attentive server. I'm not sure if I will give City Grill another shot, I just know that if I do I will skip the burger.",0
"I went in today after having bought a Groupon about a month ago. \n\nThe Groupon said: \n\nChoose Between Two Options\n*$11 for one shellac gel fingernail polish (a $25 value)\n*$30 for three Groupons, each good for a shellac gel fingernail polish (a $75 total value)\nTechs trim nails, file,buffs and apply choice of polish, Shellac, OPI or Gelish maintains chip-free for up to 14 days.\nThe Fine Print\nExpires Jan 23rd, 2014. Limit 1 per person. Limit 1 per visit. Valid only for option purchased. Appointment recommended. Merchant is solely responsible to purchasers for the care and quality of the advertised goods and services. See the rules that apply to all deals. \n\nI just purchased one and am glad that I did not purchase more because they did not honor the Groupon deal as expected.  After the manicure, the lady asked to see my coupon, so I pulled up the Groupon voucher.  She then told  me it would be $10.   (When I first walked in, I specifically told her that I had a Groupon and she did not ask me if I wanted a \""""$10 upgrade\"""" to a manicure - she just jumped right in to do the manicure.) \n\nIn any case, I didn't feel like arguing over the $10 so I just paid it and left and also gave her a tip.\n\nAfter I got home and inspected my nails, I was totally disappointed in that she had screwed up 2 of my fingernails. I think the tip was way too generous given that she did a terrible job. I usually get 2 gel manicures per month, and I have to say compared to my normal manicures, this is the worst I have ever had. \n\nI will definitely not be going back to this salon.\n\nAlso, someone else wrote in their review that the Groupon was for polish only - if this was the case why did it specifically say \""""Techs trim nails, file,buffs and apply choice of polish, Shellac, OPI or Gelish maintains chip-free for up to 14 days.\""""  (To me that describes a manicure, not a simple application of polish.)  IF if didn't say this, I could see someone arguing that the deal was for application of polish only. (But in any case,  if that was their intent, they should have stated very clearly that the Groupon was for Gel Polish Application Only. They should have listed in the terms or fine print that a full manicure was not included and that you would be charged an additional $10 for the manicure.) \n\nBut either way, it seems to me the nail salon is trying to boost business and get new customers by running a Groupon deal.  However, if they make new customers unhappy because of some technicality in the wording of the Groupon, then they are just hurting their business instead of helping it.   \n\nI for one spend a lot of $ on nail services (Both gel manis and pedis) and in the future I won't be spending it at this salon based on my experience today.  There are way too many other shops in the Ballantyne area that do a better job.",0
"Went in at 8:45 - they close at 9. The girl behind the counter said the yogurt was open but the toppings were closed. They were right there, but not available. That's just laziness. It's a pass.",0
"I've began frequenting this place recently and I'm really glad I was told about it. flavorful food and large portions at a good price! Dining in is definitely the way to go here. Relax to the island music with a Hawaiian scratch made meal and delicious Hawaiian drinks!  I've tried all their items, the bowl in my opinion is the best!",1
"This is the general hub for any long distance or between city travel.  Whenever the time comes for me to travel home and back it's to this bus station I head and I'll talk here a little about both the journey and the station itself.\n\nThe station is well placed; just off Princes Street  and its back entrance leading into St James Shopping Centre.  This is really a coach station and if it's local buses you are after you want Princes Street or Georges Street which are both a quick walk away.  \n\nOnce inside it's cosy enough and a lot warmer than Waverley Station can be on a cold night.  There's usually plenty of seating, though last time I was here many of the seats had been taken out for some reason, but I'm sure they'll be back in due course.  There's a few pricey shops here, but apart from toilets not much else, but its a bus station so you can't really expect much more.  \n\nAs for the journey, if you are going long distance (and I've been on a 13 hour trip from here before) it's not too bad, but you'll want to bring a variety of things to do.  It always helps pass the time faster if you can swap activity every hour or so.  I would recommend the buses from here mostly because they're cheaper than the train for long journeys.",1
"The food is pretty good here, but the service is consistently horrible. I ordered the Catalina 1511 burger which was very good, except it was ice cold when they brought it too me. Every time I eat here, even when ordering regular beef type burgers, it is cold when it arrives. The flavor of the food is great, but service is usually bad, and was so on this occasion.",0
Never go there!\n\nFood is old and fermented. Service is slow and horrible. You need to call waitress for many times before you get coffee. And they don't want to speak English - French only.,0
"My family just had an elegant holiday dinner at The Statehouse at The Edgewater after an hour of skating on their Plaza.  There were 11 of us and we plan to make it a tradition every year when the kids come home for Christmas.  The food, service and wonderful atmosphere were all superb.\n\nGary Stebnitz",1
"Called to make an appointment for my fiance and they informed me they no longer make appointments due to the high volume of customers. No biggie, we took our chances and headed down there fairly early and there was already a few people waiting. I think we were there for about 1 1/2 hours total which was o.k. with me since the line grew increasingly long after only 30 minutes. The cut my fiance received was really good. He has had better cuts but we will definitely be returning. The end product is definitely worth the wait.",1
"We checked in at Harrah's Ak-Chin on 4/12/13 for our one year anniversary getaway.  Everything was fine for the first few hours, then it all started to hit the fan.\nThe room we were in was fine... at first.  The TV in the room, however, seemed posessed; turning itself on and off randomly.  We called facilities to get it taken care of and it was \""""fixed\"""" Friday night.  Saturday mid-day it started again.  Facilities came out, changed out the card...and it continued.  Add to that the barking dogs in the next room (the PetStay rooms were overbooked apparently) until at least 9 pm and starting again this morning (4/14/13) at 6:30 am, and you'd think I'd be done.  I'm not.  Last night in the Oasis Lounge there was a performance my husband and I wanted to see.  We showed up and were told that seating was only for those with wristbands or VIP status, and standing in a walkway of any sort was not feasible.  Well, it's not marketed in that way.  In fact online it states \""""no admission, no reservations needed\"""".  Nowhere does it state that there is a need for a wristband, etc.\nThat brings me to Agave's.  We went for breakfast both days, however the 2nd day was ONLY because it was comped due to the aforementioned issues.  The first morning I had something god awful in my soda.  It appeared that some sort of dark black-ish mold was on a piece of ice.  The cups for soda weren't fully cleaned (as evidenced by the remnant color on the bottom of the glass) as well.\n\nDon't waste your time, money, or gas driving out here just because it's got an awesome pool.  I STILL smell like cigarettes, and I don't even smoke!",0
"GREAT Doctor! Friendly team! \n\nHate long waits at doctors office? Me too! Dr. Inga and his team are by far the most organized and friendliest staff I've encountered. Most dental offices consist of long waits, rushed appointments, and the  feeling like nothing was accomplished. I can truthfully say at Dr. Inga's office, it's always a no wait appointment and most importantly, they work with your schedule.\n\nNot only is the staff and doctor very professional but also they truly take the time to explain and answer all questions. \n\nDr. Inga really came to the rescue for me. His staff was able to get me an emergency appointment for the the worse toothache I have ever had. I was immediately taken back to the room to see what was going on. Dr. Inga took the time to explain what needed to be done and let me know that it was going to be okay. His  priority was to get me out of pain, which he did!\n\nAlso, when it came time for my exam and cleaning, Dr. Inga took his time and was very thorough. Not like majority of other offices who think a cleaning should be so quick that you walk out of there feeling like nothing was done. He explained every step of what treatment that I needed and made sure I was comfortable each step of the way. \n\nI highly recommend Dr. Inga!  GREAT DOCTOR! GREAT TEAM! GREAT WORK!",1
"I guess I had more expectations of this place from seeing it on Food Network. The food was good but the service, decor and music was not good. I only gave 2 stars since I enjoyed my meal. My daughter had the pizza and I had the cheese ravioli. \nIf you want a smile from the wait staff...good luck. One was more interested in her phone and the guy was lacking all expressions. Thankfully our waitress (I think her name was Patty) was decent.\nThe decor is outdated and could use some color...its very drab and dark in here. \nThe music is rap...this is an Italian place and the music took away from the experience. I don't think I will be back again.",0
"I definitely want to come back!\n\nWe came in a group of 4 after First Friday around 9:30 or so. We parked across the street which at first I thought was a little strange but at least we found a spot fast.\n\nThe guy at the door was super nice while carding us & liked my checkered vans.\n\nWe had to wait about 15-20 min for a table. It was pretty crowded. \n\nWe made our way outside to the back bar through a patio filled with tables, chairs, & heaters all over.\n\nThere was a DJ type guy doing music which wasn't too bad.\n\nI remember my vodka tonic being stiff. I tasted my friends hoegaarden with a slice of orange & loved it!\n\nI noticed servers can be scarce sometimes.\n\nFood:\n- Hot Vings traditional style I think. It was a HUGE plus that these automatically come wth blue cheese instead of ranch. Yay!\n- The Good 'Ol Steak Salad looked good but I didn't try it. My friend said it was pretty good.\n- The Trifecta looked mouth watering. My friend let me try his fries. OMG! Some of the best fries I've ever had. Thin & crispy on the outside while still being perfect on the inside. I almost want to say they were sweet. Like sweet potato fries? Different but amazing.\n- Southern Fried Chicken Salad was mine. The chicken was tender & a tiny bit spicy. It comes with a huge hunk of green chile cornbread that had my mouth doing happy back flips.\n\nThere's quite a range in the type of people I saw there. My group was pretty casual. We were in jeans, tennis shoes, & I had vans on. There was an older gentleman smoking a cigar, a guy that looked exactly like a younger Chris Isaak, guys in dress shirts or tees, and a lot of girls in heels. Lot of good looking people there that night! I'm gonna say you can go casual but since it's getting close to Scottsdale people do dress up just a bit.\n\nThe bathrooms are also nice. I actually barely remember them but I don't remember anything bad.",1
"Oh, Veterans Park. How you so lovingly sit quietly along Central Ave with so many amenities. Not many people know of how accessible and resourceful this little Plaza Midwood assett truly is. \n\nStomp the break, the entrance comes up quickly, and pull up the long drive into the abundant parking lot. There are several tennis courts open for public use that stay lit into the evening hours. Get your game face on, shave that McEnroe mustache and grab your racket. Some experienced players show up to these courts on a daily basis. \n\nThis facility is perfect for an afternoon pickup game of softball/baseball, basketball or bocce. Also, many mountain bikers can be seen riding throughout the small wooded area and more open fields. \n\nBring the kiddos, too. There's a fantastic playground and, dare I say, a fantastic covered water fountain pavilion. Don't have kids? Pshh. Even the adults will have fun. Jets of water spraying out of the ground make for laughable memories and beat the heat like your mama didn't know. \n\nThere are plenty of trees to sit under and get in an afternoon of reading with your current literary treasure as well. \n\nI love this park and miss frequenting several times a week. One of the more quiet parks in town and is worth a visit!",1
"The view here is amazing! Definitely worth coming here just for that. We decided to come here for pre-dinner drinks since the restaurant wasn't open. \n\nUpon entering we were greeted by the hostess (shorter, brown hair) and she was super cold. She did smile, she didn't even say welcome, I'm almost sure she didn't even look at us, because as 5 of us were standing in front of her, she ask if we had 4 in our party. She just asked us for our last name that was pretty much it. For being such a high end upscale hotel, with a beautiful view, it ruined the experience. We knew she knew how to smile because talking to her coworker she smiled.\n\nOur waitress was really nice. We had the crafty Moscow and berry Bellini. \nThe crafty Moscow was super good. The ginger was strong which I loved, but I can see if you don't like ginger, you wouldn't like it. My friend had the berry Bellini didn't like it. Cocktails were $18. \n\nFor the view and the crafty Moscow I would give it 4 stars, but the hostess killed it.",0
"This place is a bit sketchy, and it's best if you speak Chinese.  But they do serve congee!  Which is awesome--although not the best, only place I've found in town that does it so check them out if you're feeling a bit under the weather. Otherwise, try out one of the other small Chinese places on campus for a less suspicious experience.",0
"The Titanic exhibit is absolutely worth doing if you have never seen it before.  First, you are given an ID of a specific person that you can track throughout the exhibit.  You can see their profession, ticket class, and, of course, if they live or die at the end.  It makes the experience a little more personal and fun.\n\nAs you walk throughout the museum, you get the history of the titanic and different artifacts that have been recovered over the years.  The coolest aspect of the museum (well, at least in my opinion) was getting to touch the piece of ice that reflects the temperature of the water when the ship sank.  Crazy.\n\nI'd definitely recommend the Titanic exhibit if you're interested in that sort of thing or don't know much about the history.  If you are a Titanic buff, however, this may not be the best use of your money while in Vegas.  It is moderately pricey.",1
This was a 20 minute waste over cooked fish and Chix dirty tables outside .Hey the canned Mtn Dew was 5 Stars . Never been here but go to Kfc next time if you want chix. Harbor Inn or Captains Galley if you want fish. If you want dirty tables to eat on go here...,0
"First off, FOOD was EXCELLENT but the service was terrible and unnecessarily so.    We had called ahead to let them know that we were a little late for our reservation. 10 minutes and I believe the standard allowable is 15 min.     Arrived to be told that they gave our table away and that we would have to wait for it.   Told them that was not satisfactory, that we had called ahead and were told this would be no problem.   They said they would see what they could do.   We were okay with that because we had found a table in the bar and figured we could have a few drinks.    Waited almost 40 minutes and asked 3 times for a bar menu.   This waiter ( I assume) kind of wander by and finally gave us an Ipad with no explanation as to what to do with it.   Tried to use it and it didn't work.   The same waiter came back and took it away and never came back???   At 50 minutes in, we asked about our table again and they said \""""Oh that's right, come with me,\""""  I'm guessing they forgot we were waiting???   We finally get seated and immediately ask for our drinks.   We again, had this Ipad given to us that didn't work.    Now an hour in, we asked somebody to please just take our drink order and bring us something.   Maybe the desperate plea is what they were waiting for because I'm assuming our \""""waiter\"""" finally came over and took our drink order.   It took a second request to \""""bring our drinks sometime...today\"""" and a half hour before our drinks finally arrived.   They then took our order and at this point we felt trapped.  We were hungry but hated being there but our friends were jet lag and not up for hunting down another place and waiting more time to get food.   So we reluctantly placed our order.   The food again was excellent but took about 30 minutes to come out.   But the service for our table was the equivalent to being served at a Denny's.   Our tableware was practically thrown on our table and made clanking noises when placed.  When our food was served, it was shoved in front of us to the point that our food slid to the other side of the plate.   \n\nIn total, we spent 3.5 hours there and only an hour of it eating.  2.5 was spent trying to get drinks, food...someone to acknowledge us?!?!    I hate writing these type of reviews because I feel like I'm whining but honestly it was this bad.   Not sure if this was an off night or new staff but it's unacceptable and I don't recommend dinner here.",0
So delicious!\nCan tell meat has something special source in it.,1
"Las Vegas Premium Outlets has always been the better of the Las Vegas area outlet malls. However, since they have redone the outlets down on the south end of Las Vegas Boulevard and made them into Las Vegas Premium Outlets North the original location has really lost its edge. The store selection here is now only SLIGHTLY better instead of being way better. And the southern location while crowded is not as mobbed as the original. This place has great hours; especially a plus is that it is open late on Sunday (after 6 PM). Considering this is 2014 and the era of internet shopping and a 24-7 town, they often get my business when I need to shop on a Sunday and the malls close early in Vegas. This mall is great for people watching as well! However, this mall is also the 'United Nations' of Las Vegas because it is so overrun with foreign tourists, many whom are rude or stupid and roll suitcases around and shove clothes in them. I guess this is why they sell heavy coats and fleece in many of the stores here considering you will only wear those on a handful of instances during a winter day in Las Vegas and maybe 30 times at night a winter. The only negative about the location is it is not in walking distance to any tourist areas (maybe downtown if you really want to walk) and for locals near the Spaghetti Bowl which is a major mess most of the time due to traffic. If you are on the south end of the valley, try the south outlets or even consider driving to Primm to the Outlet Mall there.",1
"Worst pizza in the world! I wouldnt take there pizza for free let alone 30$ for it. Much better choices in town. Service is not professional and lacks attention mid week afternoon shifts. The bartender has to serve you because theres no waitstaff on floor. The place is so dead, they dont staff and it effects service.",0
"Food is good! Service sucks....\n\nI'm here on a Monday at 2pm and there are 2 waiters running around, one is a scatter brain and looks stressed...and there are about 5 tables...I think 2 waiters should be able to take care of 5 tables. I was a waiter once and had to take care of 6 tables by myself.\n\nFood me and my friends ordered (total 4 of us):\n- Ramen DX - love the soup base\n- Smelt fish - the small fish with the smelt eggs inside yummm\n- Squid - half was dry (probably from sitting on the counter too long and the waitress forgot to give it to us until later)\n- Seaweed salad - good, more salad then seaweed though\n- Salmon sashimi - good\n- Spicy tuna roll - good\n- Okra - good, fresh\n- Fire roasted eggplant - good\n\n\nThings they forgot:\n-Spider roll - good if we actually got it on time (they gave it to the table next to us and when they realized we ordered it they took it off their table and gave it to us)\n-Coffee (be aware that their coffee is $4.50...like the price of Starbucks but tastes weak and is in a small cup)\n-We asked twice for them to refill our water\n-We ordered 2 Half ramen and only one came and they forgot the soup...by the time they brought out the soup the noodles had dried up and stuck together...then an hour later they brought out my friends half ramen\n- Pot Stickers (they took forever on this one and we asked twice and finally decided to cancel it because when we looked over at the waitress it looked like she forgot again)\n\nKeep in mind we placed this order all together in the beginning and didn't add on anything and they still messed up.\n\nSo 2 stars for good food but horrible service, I would've given 1 star if the food was bad as well. We gave $1.00 tip on our $74.00 bill and left.",0
"I was really hoping to enjoy this brewery more than I did. I think with such high reviews, I had high expectations of what I would find. \n\nAs another post says its not \""""Four Peaks\"""" and I'm assuming they are referring to the appearance and ambiance of the place. It came off really divvy and deteriorated to me with a dirty bar top and messy floors. The bathrooms were awful like something out of a truck stop and there was a complaint about the women's restroom overflowing while I was sitting at the bar. The bar keep just kind of shrugged it off in acknowledgment and did nothing. She didn't do much of anything in terms of explaining the place or the beer selection after asking about what was available. \n\nIt was completely dead on a Monday afternoon at happy hour so I can't speak much for how loud it gets. They did have a good beer selection on tap, so that is their obvious pull for people. Can't speak on their food is as I left after my second beer, just couldn't stomach the place after poor service and crappy atmosphere. \n\nI like a dive just as much as the next trendy hipster with a mustache but when the service is lousy, decor is boring, and things are a bit pricey. its time to move on to the next one.",0
"Let me say, this is not a store where the employees will be nice to you, ask you if you need help finding anything, or do anything at all to make you feel welcome, but it's soooo worth it.  \n\nThis dump has everything.

Tiny pink and blue clothespins, cute little patches, bra straps, fake fur in every color of the rainbow, mini-chain by the yard, huge bins of zippers...I could go on and on.  If you make crafts you need to come to this store.  The prices are pretty good, too.  It's a magical place, complete with the angry trolls that cut your fabric and take your payment.",1

"Wife and I went to have lunch and try their pizza buffet that they recently reintroduced. While the pizza was pretty good and on-par with their normal pizza menu offerings, we were still disappointed. They do not have salad now (which they used to have) and their pasta is very similar to their pasta offerings EXCEPT that their is no meat or chicken in the pasta offerings. If their was any meat or chicken, it was in such small quantities that you could not see it or tell. They do have a small side salad for additional cost, but that too is very, very small. While their pizza is normal, the rest of the buffet is substandard. For the price, CiCi's is better, even if the pizza is of lesser quality.",0
Love Total Wine. Best booze selection I've ever seen. \n\nThe wine options are a bit confusing because I don't know wine very well. \n\nThe beer selections are phenomenal. \n\nI always spend more than I expect or want to but I always leave happy!,1
"Located inside Aria, this is a fancy looking cocktail lounge with great music. I liked how everything was so nicely set up. Someone would come by every now and then to clean up your table and to reorganize things nicely as they were each time. \nThe reason why I gave them 2 stars however is because of the cocktail. I tried 2 of their signature cocktails, but I felt like they really weren't that good especially considering the price. Perhaps it was supposed to be a savory cocktail or something, but it all just tasted to funky for me. I requested for something really sweet, and that was the recommendation I got. \nIf you are looking for somewhere \""""nice\"""" atmosphere wise, this is the place to go to, but otherwise don't go.",0
"I guess Emeril is too busy sitting on his laurels to realize that this is one of the worse resteraunts in the Palazzo.  The food lacks originality and more importantly flavor.

"Lobby bar has very slow service. We sat there for almost 20 minutes before being waited on. Many other customers were getting irritated as well for the same reason. I love the movie and dinner idea, but again drink service during the movie was very slow. You get immediate attention when pushing the service button, but we waited forever for the drinks to actually get to us. The food was pretty good, but prices a bit high. I have to mention that the employees that took the tickets at the entrance were rude and immature. They just grabbed the tickets and started talking to one another...no personal customer service at all. Summary: great business idea, but hire some mature workers and make sure you have enough employees on hand to take care of your customers.",0
"Best club I've been to in my life and I've seen my fair share.  \n\nSTAY AT THE WYNN OR ENCORE\nStayed at the Wynn and XS is literally around the corner from the resort elevators.  Get in line at around 9, wait half an hour, get a stamp for ins-n-outs, and go back to the room throughout the night for a free drink, yay, or a J...  whatever your poison.  Get in line after 10 and good luck getting in... some of our friends didn't.  \n\nPOOL AREA\nThe main reason I enjoyed this club, especially as a smoker, is the large, open-air pool area.  Luckily we found a free \""""sofa-recliner\"""" that sits in the shallow area of the pool where you can dip your feet or lay back and watch the crowd - I suggest you grab one.  My wife and I partied, fell asleep on the recliner for an hour around 1am, woke up, grabbed another drink, had someone hold our spot, got back on the dance floor, and back to our seat until the club closed.\n\nBottle service tables around the pool don't seem VIP at all.  Close to impossible to get on guestlist for the average Joe.  FYI:  The table reservations line was the same length as the general admission line at around 11:30pm.\n\nWent here on a Saturday.  They played a mix of house and hip hop.  $14 Jack and Cokes are worth it because drinks are 1.5x - 2x larger than normal.  $14 henny shots not worth it when you have some in the room.  Admission: $30 guys, $20 girls.",1
"I've eaten in once and gotten delivery once from Thai Pod and both times the service, or rather severe lack thereof let this place down.\n\nThe food, to their credit, was fabulous, but waiting over an hour (both sitting in & delivery) for it to arrive really just isn't good enough.

"Came to the strip house before seeing peep show sat 10/6, love the d\u00e9cor and ambiance, the service is absolutely amazing.\nMini ciabata rolls are great very fresh they give you three cranberry, garlic cheese, and sourdough maybe.\nStrip house margarita it would have been ok but I forgot to tell them not to salt the glass (my fault, but ruined the drink for me) honestly I expected better drinks from a high end restaurant in Vegas\nFrench connection was made perfectly\nCaesar salad wonderful dressing anchovies were present and the croutons were delish nice cheese and garlic addition, fresh cracked pepper rounded it out \nLobster Bisque I've had better and the portion of lobster left so much to be desired and was pretty disappointing for the cost\nCrisply Scottish Salmon 5 stars! (The picture I've attached is of this dish) it was amazing and beautifully presented \n14 oz steak, my dinner companion said it was well worth the $54 price tag   \n\nThe above mentioned meal was $175 with tax and tip, we were in Vegas enjoying ourselves so why not but I think Morton's and Flemings are better (I don't eat steak so that opinion is based on seafood, drinks, and side dishes)",1
"I have been coming to this auto repair shop for 1-2 years now and until now I've been very happy with the service. I took my truck in there two weeks ago for a fairly simple fix and they wanted to charge me an arm and a leg for all these extra parts that weren't necessary. I paid the extremely pricey amount and got on with my day. This time I went in there for a misfire in cylinder 4 and needed new spark plugs and wires. Now I'm not expert with cars but I know darn sure that switching the spark plugs and wires is a simple process that can be done in about an hour. These gents wanted to charge me almost $11 for each spark plug ($6.50 retail) and $75 for the wire kit which runs about $50 normally. Now I understand that you've got to charge a premium when you're at the auto body shop but the labor cost is what made me sick. They charged me 2.5 hours of labor ($98/hr) just to switch out the plugs and wires. That is an absolute joke! \n\nThese guys do good work but they screw you on the labor costs. Be mindful. Needless to say, I will never go back to this shop again.",0
"Be careful. The servers can't pay attention to save their lives, and the management cares even less. I want to make sure people know how careless the management is, particularly Mark who seems to let his staff run around.",0
"My husband and I decided to eat some lunch at Sonny's in Concord.  That was a big mistake!  We asked the waitress what was on the $5.99 lunch special plate and she said you get two pieces of chicken, white or dark, french fries, slaw and garlic bread.  She or you can have any meat of your choice.  We chose the white meat chicken.  When our meal came there was a small wing and half of a chicken breast!\nYou could see where the breast was cut in half.  She tried to tell us that sometimes the pieces are small.  I told her don't even go there.  I know the difference from a small piece of chicken and one that has been cut in half.  I have cooked chicken all my life and I know what I am talking about!  They refused to make it good and we will never ever go there again because they are cheating the customers and we did not get what we paid for!!!!  They really do not even deserve one star!!!!!\nbev christenbury",0
"Food was superb, prices were good, atmosphere was ok, but it was busy and service really suffered.  We had the spaghetti western,  pizza, sole with pasta and a glass of wine ( all very tasty) $55 out the door.   I'll be back!",1
Brisket is good.  Service isn't all that. Pricy in my opinion.  Small side $2.25. Med $5.75!  One size soda cup $2.25.,0
"I am giving this place ONE star for the following reasons; first off the order took an hour and a half to be delivered. When we received our order, it was wrong. We paid extra for the thick crust on our pizza and also pepperoni. What we actually got was a PLAIN, COLD, cheese pizza that was thin and had obviously been sitting for a long time. We also ordered the Philly cheese steak sandwich. My husband is highly allergic to onions so we specified NO ONIONS on the sandwich, and what did it come with? ONIONS!!! After waiting an hour and a half for our order which was WRONG, obviously we were pretty irritated. We called them right away and got no answer. So we waited until the next day to call and complain. I can think of about fifty other things I'd rather spend $30 on than the horrible \""""meal\"""" we received from this place. We spoke to Ray who identified himself as the owner and were casually dismissed and he told us he had to talk to the employees who worked the night before and blah blah and he said to call back tomorrow. He was rude and completely dismissed the situation. We will NEVER order from them again!!!!!!",0
We're from San Diego where great Chinese food is everywhere. This place is probably the best we've had on this side of town. Great lunch specials and the dinners are good as well. Casual atmosphere but nice.,1
I've been here several times and the first two times were decent. I like their thin bread. But the last few times (4+) I've been here it's been very dirty. Every table has leftover food mess on it. The last time I was here it was so bad I asked a server to come wipe a table down. He did - but he didn't bother to clean the others while he was at it. They were still gross when I left.\n\nCame back today and it's the same thing. If the hygiene is this bad out front I fear for what it's like where you can't see. I probably won't be coming back.,0
"Unfortunately this place did not have the best food. I do not recommend the shrimp pasta, it came with super tiny canned shrimp for salads and not very many of them. I was wanting a seafood meal and this was not it. We were the youngest group in the whole restaurant but it was picked as an overall middle of the road place for a large group of people driving from all around town. The service was ok. I did not pay for the pasta dish as it was not good at all but I definitely paid $6 for the super small side salad that came with the meal. Overall I do not recommend this place although as stated in another post they have the best bread ever and the rest of the guests at our table seemed to enjoy their meals. I tasted my husband's food and it was way better than mine.",0
"My fianc\u00e9 and I came here to celebrate our anniversary.  Since it was Light Up Night, aside from the amazing food and service, we were able to see two and a half amazing fireworks shows!  \nFrom the moment we entered, we knew we were in for a special treat.  We were early for our reservation, but to kill the time, the owner greeted us with complementary glasses of champagne.  Shortly after, we were escorted upstairs to our window view table.  The view of the downtown skyline was stunning.\nThe only option for the evening was the $70, seven course prix fixe menu.  It was well worth the splurge.  Service was extremely attentive without being overbearing.  Our waiter provided a description of each course as it was brought over which provided very useful information considering we were eating dishes that we don't have on a regular basis.  \nThe owner made the rounds several times, including one to take our photos and one to give us a printed copy in a folder that said Isabela's.  It was a nice touch and a great way to remember such a fantastic evening.\nI chose to get the wine pairings which provided a glass of wine with each course that I chose.  The pairings worked fantastically and the wines were very tasty.  However, four full glasses of wine was a bit much for one person, even with the spaced out dining.  If you chose the pairing option, you may want to share the wine with a dining companion.\nSince it was Light Up Night, we were able to see two amazing fireworks displays in addition to an amazing meal.\nThe only thing that was even remotely a dislike was the fact that the tables are close together.  Not so much that you can't get in and out, but enough that you don't feel very private.\nOverall, an amazing experience with great food, amazing service and a stunning view.  I hope I will be able to return for some future special occasion!",1
"While I'm not much of a Hippie nor a Gypsy per se, I can't really comment on much of the items in this place used for...ahem...uh, \""""elevating one's conscience\""""?. However, I do like to Zen out and burn incense often and the Hippie Gypsy has the best selection of incense in town, they must have around 50 or so different kinds which is awesome and they're really inexpensive as well so I usually pick up around 20sticks for 2$.  The Hippies that work there are usually pretty cool too.",1
"I can't even say how the food is. I was here for 20 min, asked a waitress if I could order then she never came back. 15 minutes after that another one said it might be best if I got my own drinks from the bar. Are you kidding me? NEVER going back.",0
"Delmonico's does not disappoint. Its a classic, upscale steakhouse with absolutely fantastic food. I go to Vegas every Memorial Day weekend and every year I pick a different Vegas steakhouse for one of my dinners. Last year was Cut and I was EXTREMELY disappointed. Delmonico however was fabulous. I had the lettuce wedge salad and the filet oscar and both were absolutely delicious. My husband had the spinach frisee salad and the filet au poivre and he also really enjoyed them. The food, atmosphere, everything was just fabulous! The only thing to be aware of is that its VERY expensive-- the filet oscar was $70! But its Vegas and its Emeril and its a fantasic restaurant so its well worth it for a night out.  I will definitely be back.",1
"We were there for drinks and hanging out. There is a $5 cover charge for men. Got there noticed 3 different bar stations, 1 dance floor, 1 bull ride area, and outside patio. The music was a weird mix (hip hop, pop, rock n roll, with a mix of country). It is OK. The crowd was a mix of 20 to 30s, and drop in a few 40s+. Drinks were expensive!",0
"If you love thin and crispy pizza this is the place for you. The freshest ingredients your going to get .  Expect to wait a while for your pizza, but its so worth it . I wonder how good the wings and ceviche is ? TBA",1
FnB is an experience that is best enjoyed when you leave your comfort zone at the door before entering. \n\nThere's no praise that I can heap on top of the praises that have already been given by others- you will have a memorable meal here for all of the right reasons.,1
"I ordered a mixed drink. Bartender grabs a glass, fills it 3/4 of the way with ice, pours in alcohol and soda just until the ice starts to float, and then grabs the ice scooper and adds MORE ICE TO MY GLASS.\n\nThis place blows.",0
"My friend had her bday dinner here... The reservation was for 830 we didn't get seated till 930 945 ... The food is good but not worth the money the meat inside the banana peppers(veal and angus beef) was over cooked, duck was chewy, salmon was tasteless, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was runny but I will say the forty dollar crab cakes were pretty great. No breeding straight lumpy crabmeat! .... Oh and did I mention the view??? That was also great!",1
The worst chairs on a planet.,0
"Great show! \nI laughed and was entertained the WHOLE entire time. \nGive you a tip of what this show is all about, it's in the name, it's like America's got talent but all these performers have the talent and will keep you laughing and wanting more! \n\nSmall venue, so please don't expect this HUGE thing from what your used to from the other shows you've seen in Vegas. \n\nGroupon deal, $69.00 for two admission and it was well spent! \n\nCome early because it's first come first serve for the seating if your not VIP. Just a little heads up. \n\nThey take your picture and you can pick it up at the end of the show for $10 and you get to meet all the performers at the end. =)",1
"Crab Corner was so impressive the first time we ate there, my wife and I went back with our friends the next night. \n\njust a great restaurant! The crab is awesome. Tried all their crab... Blue Crab was excellent and very authentic Maryland style. The king crab was juicy and sweet. Add seasoning and butter and it's probably the best king crab I've ever had. \n\nI usually don't care for snow crab but Crab Corner nailed it perfect. Sweet and juicy. \n\nDefinitely ask for a bib because it will get messy. \n\nCrab Corner is a different style vs Hot n Juicy, so it's not quite fair to compare.",1
"Amazing donuts  and great owners. Thank you for being open on Christmas, we devoured each and everyone of them. So fresh and yummy, I will never go anywhere else!!",1
"Such a fun bit of Americana! A friend had his birthday celebration here and  I must say that it was quite the entertaining experience. Food's OK and not too badly priced, considering the entertainment that comes with it; and, $2 mugs of beer on tap ... yes!\n\nThe Wurlitzer was impressive: around 6000 pipes and 4 large turbine blowers make it one of the largest theater organs in the world. The pipes themselves, as well as accessory instruments - piano, percussion instruments, even a mechanical quacking duck - are scattered around the interior of the building and displayed and lit to become part of a grand light and sound show. I thoroughly enjoyed the organist's performance, which ranged from folk to pop (including adventure and sci-fi movie themes) to classical pieces. The performance ends with a sing-along.\n\nPretty much all ages are represented in the customer demographic, from toddlers to seniors, but leaning heavily toward family groups. Kids definitely love the place, as I saw many of them break away from their families to go beside the organ platform and spontaneously dance to the music.",1
Been eating here much longer than I have lived in Vegas.  Great sushi most of the time and great service most of the time.  I've had one or two visits where I either got a rare totally mediocre roll or had to wait an inordinate amount of time for something simple.  It'll always be the first place I plan to go when we talk about sushi.,1
"I love Sara!  The other night I was going out, such a treat - I had an appt to have Sara give me cool beach waves with my magic curling wand!  She was exactly on  time, I was in and out of there in 30 minutes!  love her!  Thanks Sara!",1
"First off, I'm New Yorker who takes her bagels seriously. So when people told me I HAD to try bagels in Montreal, I was a bit skeptical. Could they really be anywhere near as good as in NY?\n\nWell, we stopped in here around 9:30 PM on a Friday night and got fresh hot sesame bagels, right out of the wood fired oven.  They were delicious! Of course, how can you go wrong when they are fresh out of the oven?!\n\nOverall, the bagels are much lighter than NY bagels - there is no chewy denseness that typifies the NY style.  The shape was also a bit different -- narrower with a much bigger hole in the middle.  So generally, they seemed a bit smaller than what you would get in NY.  The \""""savory\"""" bagels we bought were slightly sweet - apparently they boil them in sweetened water which is part of what distinguishes them. \n\nI would definitely recommend getting some of these -- especially if you can get them fresh out of the oven!",1

"I would not come back here simply because I don't feel safe in this hotel. \n\nIt's a nice, relatively cheap place to stay while in Vegas. Not too far from the strip. There were some problems like bathroom locks not working properly, lights are weird, fridge wasn't working so staff had to bring up ice, etc.. But I still won't come back.\n\nNight one: A couple of girls get money stolen out of their wallets after leaving to go out for the night. We thought this might have been a mishap or miscounting of money or whatever, but it was $40 per girl and that is a lot of money when each girl only brings about $100 cash total. \n\nNight two: We all leave at 9:30PM for the night and come back around 2:30AM. This time around we were going to head out again for the night to go to get food and some girls that left their wallets out got  $40 stolen out of them. This time it was obvious because it happened the night before, it was the same amount, and the girls needed money to go out and eat... plus wallets and items were not placed in the same place or zipped up correctly. \n\nI decided to stay back with two girl friends while the rest of the group went to go out and eat. My friends fell asleep, but I was awake eating my leftovers and just hanging out on the inside one of the bedrooms when I hear a knock on the door. The first time, I ignored it (I WAS NOT getting up unless someone called me on my cell phone). Later on in the night, I heard a knock again so I go up to see if anyone was there. There wasn't.. and it kind of freaked me out. (Benefit of the doubt, it could have been another room being knocked on and I was paranoid). \n\nTo be honest though, the next day I realized that anyone could have gone into the room without me or my friends noticing because the doors are SO EXTREMELY QUIET (this would be a plus if people didn't steal stuff from our rooms) or it sounds like it's coming from the rest of the hotel. Someone could have definitely come in, saw my friends sleeping through the bedroom door and left all without me knowing. \n\nInformed the staff the next day & they checked \""""maintenance records\"""" to see if any of the workers came into the room... of course there's are no records. Also told us to fill out a survey and they would get back to the group... & they still haven't responded. It's not a lot of money, but the hotel should still follow up OR at least make sure their employees are not doing this.\n\nFor people staying: lock up your belongings in the safe or somewhere hidden in your luggage. Don't let shady stuff happen! I'm just thankful that my whole group is safe and this was the only mishappening of the weekend.",0
"I don't get some of these poor reviews.  The decor is spare but attractive, the place seems clean enough to me, the prices are good, and I've never had a bad meal there over the past 20 years.  My current favorite is the mussels, either ginger-and-onion  or black-bean.  The mussels are big and plump and plentiful, nicely presented and piping hot.  My friends have liked their dishes, too.  I've had worse Chinese food (including in China), but seldom better.  Just wish I lived closer, but I can always make an excuse to travel to a place I like as much as GHHK.",1
"i love the irony of embracing love and peace for marketing purposes, but espousing the opposite sentiment when being interviewed for newspaper articles.  http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09291/1006134-28.stm\n\nIt kinda makes the donuts taste bitter.  Oh, and Ron, i'm  a centrist, \""""right to bear..., take personal responsibility...\"""" kinda guy, so don't brush me off as another one of those LGBT radicals trying to keep you down.  If your marketing was based on 1950's kitsche, i don't think people would mind you preaching morality nearly as much.  seriously, it's the blatantly misrepresentative marketing that especially irks people.    \n\nAnyway, in all honesty the donuts are decent.. some of the flavors are downright tasty.  i won't knock em.  a tasty snack, though probably not the place i'd go when it's my day to buy donuts - due to price and size.",0
"We decided to run off and get married in the drive thru. First the got us for the 149.300 package with pics and a video.  Then the MInister asked if we cared if he prayed for us, I didn't care but we opted out.  You are then handed an envelope and are more less required to give a min donation of $40.00 to the Minister BEFORE he does the ceremony.  While we waited in the 110 degree heat, we learned that they would have to bring us our video and pics to our hotel, some tech issues.  The photographer handed you a clip board for you to sign and mark how much your photograher donation would be.    All I could do was laugh during the ceremony.  It was not romantic and just a big let down.  Needless to say we only gave $20.00 tip to the minister and our paperwork still isn't filed with the Clark County Recorders Office.  My advise is if it's gonna be hot the day you get married, do it in the early morning or very very late at night!\nGood luck and Bless you all on your futures.

"Primebar is a fun spot at the Scottsdale Quarter, great ambiance and great deals during happy hour.  They have a good selection of small plates and drinks at discounted prices.  \n\nHappy hour small plates are good sized portions and have everything from a delicious tomato and basil flatbread to fried calamari to deviled eggs and spinach queso dip.   Very easy to make a meal out of these appetizers!  \n\nRegular restaurant items and drinks are a little pricey, but not overly expensive for this part of town.  The service when I've been there is generally good, but it can get pretty slammed on a Friday or Saturday night.  On some weekend nights they have live music and it's definitely a 'place to be' in the Scottsdale Quarter - typically an older crowd than you would find in downtown Scottsdale.",1

"If you are into being scammed and treated like dirt, buy your car here!!  \nMy wife and I ordered a 2014 Highlander LE Plus to be built exactly to our liking at another downtown dealership.  We live in the Centennial Hills area so we thought we would just take a look to compare.  Of course, dealerships are good at getting you to go in and sit down to have a \""""chat\"""".  We told them our situation and they couldn't compete with our pre-ordered vehicle because they don't have any LE Plus models on their lot.  The manager then said that they want us to walk out with a Limited edition.  We told them that it is outside of our budge as their available inventory was well above $40k.  They told us to name them a price and after some hesitation, we did.  It was a low one, and we told them that we know its a low one simply because we didnt want to exceed our budget.  We were ok not getting the Limited as we were excited about our LE Plus that was soon arriving.  They went back to the GM who approved the deal.  We have told them our plans to trade in my wife's old car, including our owing balance.  They also came back and said, no problem... they will do it.  So we were excited.  We wanted to go back the next day with money and all but our sales guy said he was off so we went back Friday (2 days after the deal was made).  We go Friday with a cashiers check and cash to pay for the vehicle planning maybe an hour tops for paperwork.  We sit there for over two hours, waiting for the documents to come so we can sign and drive off.  Then sales guy comes back saying that the same GM, who approved and lured us into spending over our budget, is now over the phone saying that he can't sell it to us at that price.  Got Joe, the floor manager involved.  He tried to do the typical car salesman buttering up but that doesnt fly with me.  So all he said to me was \""""we dont even have to sell you this car at all!\"""".  They said they won't take our trade-in either and that we have to pay more for the vehicle.  Long story short, because we needed a bigger car, we paid their proposed higher price anyway.  But during the entire process, even the finance manager, who chimed in annoyingly, was very condescending.  They treated us like we just robbed them and took advantage of them... like we were scums... when really they were pulling something shady last minute.  Since then, the only person kind enough and cared enough was Debbie, the customer relations manager, who has been wonderful... however, there are limitations to what she could assist with.  None of the higher management is concerned enough or have the courtesy to call me back to discuss the situation.  \nLastly, our title has been sent to the wrong place TWICE... and still at this point (over two momths after the purchase) we dont know if that issue has been corrected by the dealership yet.  It was a piece of paper our bank provided to give to the dealership, with all very clearly stated instructions and address to send the title.  Somehow it is done incorrectly twice, and counting. \n\nSo yes, if you want this kind of first-class service and this kind of hassle-free experience, buy your cars to your hearts content here!",0
"Just another Chinese Buffet, with all the same standard items as most.  The reason for 4 stars?

"I came here for dinner with colleagues on a business trip. I had been scrolling through Yelp trying to find something exactly like this, when my colleague beat me to it and declared this was where we would be dining. \n\nWe walked here from Bakery Square (which I wouldn't do in the daylight if you are not intrepid, and I would not do at night at all). The restaurant is beautiful in an understated, and chic way. The service was very good from beginning to end. We were promptly greeted and seated (we had reservations) at a beautiful corner table. \n\nI remember taking a very long time perusing the menu and trying to decide what to have. It all looked really delicious. There were also many options for omnivores, carnivores, vegetarians, pescatarians (I'm not sure about vegan). I try not to eat mammals, but everything looked delicious. They serve fresh and locally-sourced food as much as possible.\n\nI chose a salad (the menu seems to change that was amazing!) and my colleagues got the blue cheese souffle and said it was dreamy. They also both ordered the hanger steak, which they found to be delicious as well. I had a seasonal fish entree that was divine. \n\nThe wine was also dreamy. Make sure the peruse the wine list. The descriptions are delightful and spot-on! \n\nOur only complaint was that we could not keep our wine away from the gnats. I wasn't too flummoxed by it, but one of our party was a little distracted by the issue.\n\nWhen it came time to go, we asked the waitress if a cab could be called for us. She said the cabs in Pittsburgh are famously slow and unreliable, and the restaurant called a \""""car service\"""" for us. It was literally a dude in his minivan, but he arrived quickly and took us right back to the hotel. :)\n\nI will definitely drop in here again when I am in Pittsburgh. I would love to sample more of the seasonal menu items and try a few of the \""""regulars,\"""" too. The tasting menus look delightful as well.",1
"I was looking up their phone number and saw the yelps so I had to add my review as they didn't seem to have been given a fair shot. It's not the giant Safeway but they have a nice variety which seems to cater to the community they serve. I've asked for things they didn't have over the years and they made it happen. Their floral department gets several visits a year from me and they will put together a special request any time the florist is in, which for me, seems to be most of the time. I just had a special b-day arrangement created for one of my daughters with a bouquet of balloons for 4:30 today and I called at 2. Quick, fresh and fairly priced. This store covers 70% or so of our grocery shopping and has done so for the 15 years we've lived in the Foothills. Everyone is friendly and helpful, the manager is always ready to assist you and remembers who you are. This is our neighborhood market",1
"Refused to accommodate a food allergy, which simply would have involved using rice without shitlantro in it.\n\nDefinitely will not waste my time coming here again, when Chipotle is just up the street, and is willing to accommodate an easy request.",0
"Yummy as always.  Diego from the var knows how to make my favorite cocktail, the Derby (with Bookers).\n\nEscargot good as always and the goat cheese is so incredible creamy and delicious.  Wow!\n\nI did ask for \""""Spanish Anchovies\"""" ( white) on my salad, but got Chilean (brown) instead.  Big difference!  Please learn.\n\nOtherwise, an amazing grastronomical experience.\n\nOur waiter is amazing!",1
"A must for foodies with a fine sense of attention to detail!  A good friend and I had a  wonderful wine paired dinner about 2 months ago.  We both had the 5 course tasting menu.  I'm not too sure but it may have changed to the new fall/winter menu but with  talented Chef Gary LaMorte at the wheel, I see no hesitation for anyone to give Andre's a try!  \nThe first thing that will catch your eye is that this restaurant is not like your normal Las Vegas fine dinning eatery.  You stroll into the beautiful bar into a very intimate dinning room.  I would say about a 50 seater.  What really catches your attention is the decor of the room. Elegant but not too over the top. The room is set with a lot of space in between tables, often this is over looked when other restaurants try to cram as many tables into a room.  I loved how you felt old school, and new school at the same time.  \nI would highly recommend the tasting menu with wine pairings.  Every course that came to our table was greeted with Chef Gary coming to the table and explaining the dish!  I think that is so key to see the Chef come out into the dinning room to greet guests!  I know that depending on service the Chef may not make it to every single table, but that fact that other diners see the Chef making effort to get to they guests, is something that you don't see everyday in Las Vegas. \nNow for the food!!!!!!!   All I have to say is that this was the best (by far) dinning experience that I have had!  Like I said before ATTENTION TO DETAIL is on every dish! From the amuse, to dessert, everything was spot on!  First course was poached lobster and foie, roasted pistachio puree, Casi's reduction.  You might laugh at this but not to take away from the lobster and foie, but the puree was UNREAL!!!!!!  Texture on that was so so so smooth!  This dish was served with a foie, martini.  If your a foie fan, and a martini fan this is another must have!!!!  Next course, seared day boat scallop, sturgeon fish caviar, smoked scallop slices, pearl yam puree, curry sauce.  With this dish everything just went very very well together.  Next course, Pan roasted king fish, fennel puree, roasted red beet, citrus butter.  Once again bulls eye for this dish!  Next course, my favorite, veal loin, sear foie, sweetbreads, spinach, and mitake mushroom, with a cardamon jus.  I loved how the cardamon went with the sweetbread, just the right amount of sweetness to the dish.  For dessert it was some sort of chocolate mousse but not as light as a  mousse.  I loved the textures in this dish also.\nAfter the meal Chef Gary once again greeted us at the table to see how are experience went. Of course it was amazing to say the least.  I forgot to mention the upstairs cigar/conac room.  I myself is not a cigar fan, but to those who are, this IS a must!  \nSo the next time your significant other asks you, \""""Where are we gonna go for dinner?\""""  Your answer will be Andre's in the Monte Carlo!",1
"I can't remember the name of the special salad we had tonight with Shrimp, but I will never forget the taste.  FABULOUS is an understatement!  The NY pizza was equally as great.  Every time I come here I say to myself, we need to come more often.  Everything is always good.\n\nDiane was our server tonight.  What a cutie!  More important is that the service was excellent!  Diane was back at our table many times checking to see if there was anything else she could do for us.  Another comment I want to make is there was a young man taking care of the table.  At some point I thanked him and was surprised to receive \""""Your more than welcome\"""", instead of the typical \""""No Problem\"""" statement coming from young people.  I should have gone to the management to tell them I was impressed by him, his smile and mannerisms.\n\nWe will be back!",1
"We have stayed at this hotel about 5 times. The last before our trip this past weekend was 4 years ago.  wow - its changed.  You dont feel like a hotel guest here you feel like a burden on them - they make it feel like they are doing you a favor by doing their jobs.  We liked to go to Bare pool which was one reason we chose this hotel.  We called a month in advance to reserve chairs at Bare for Friday and Saturday - Friday we showed later (3pm because we just got in) and they had given our \""""reserved\"""" seats away.  He promised we would have them on Saturday.  We arrived at noon and he said he had to give our \""""reserved\"""" seats away again but he did save a day bed for $1000 for the day!  It totally ruined our saturday and they really didn't care.  Most of the bartenders will barely make eye contact with you.  Most of the staff has no idea what is going on - its like they are all new employees - they must have a high turn over rate.  Our room was not cleaned by 7pm after returning from the day.  The house keeper in the hallway told us they dont make beds anymore.  We had to call the manager and they said yes they do clean rooms and make beds, but now we had to wait until 9pm for them to come back up.  We ordered rooom service - waited an hour - called down and they did not have record of the order.  Re-ordered had to wait another hour + and call down 4 times to check on it.  Overall - its like you are lucky if any one helps you and you are more of a hassle they have to deal with, then a guest paying their checks.  The pool staff at the regular pool were nice.",0
The food and service was excellent and the decor was nice.   It seems like this is a hidden gem just off the casino floor.\n\nWe had the Chile Relleno and Pork Carnitas for our entrees and both were excellent.\n\nOnly negatives the Sangria was a little weak and the air was smoky from the casino and bar.,1
"Eaten here at least 3 times, but sorry, I just don't think the chicken is that good.  It's too tough.  once bit into some grissel in a chicken sandwich.  Fries are too skinny and greasy.  For the price, you don't get much.  I don't hold out much hope for this place considering there is a Chick-Fil-A and a KFC just down the road that consistently serve excellent chicken meals for good prices.",0
"okay so I take my two dogs here and they really seem to enjoy it.  In all honesty it is a great place for them to interact with other dogs and get out of the house and run all day.  That is why I give them a one star.  Both my dogs have been injured since going there.  Now as a dog owner I know that dogs will be dogs and sometimes around other dogs there are things that happen.  I understand that...what I don't understand is that when my one dog got hurt a few weeks back they told me when I cam to pick him up that they didn't know how it happened but he has a little scrape and not to worry they bandaged it up.  they also said that he probably did not need to go to the vet.  WELL...300 dollars later after the vet visit my dog had a torn pad.  I did not have a problem with him having a torn pad..the problem I had was that they minimized his injury and pretended like nothing happened.  So, since this happened I gave them the benefit of the doubt and took my dogs back there the next week.  WELL..guess what..when I went to pick them up they said that my other dog had a scratch or cut under his leg and it was no big deal.  I asked them what had happened and they said they didn't know, but we cleaned it up and its nothing to worry about.  I asked if I should take him to the vet and once again they said no..its no big deal....WELL.. when I got home I looked at this little cut and it was more like a gaping hole down into his flesh oozing blood..obviously it looked like another dog had bitten him.  So off to the vet we go and another 300 dollars later...he also had a ripped pad.. and the vet said that he could se where another dog had bit him because there are teeth mark in the flesh...so two visits to this place and 600 dollars later I am a little bit disenchanted by the people who work here.  I kind of sense that they weren't being honest with me with what actually happened.  It's very frustrating...my dogs love going there, but It's probably safe to say that they won't be going back.  I just think that the people working there could be a little more honest and not minimize what happened.  this is the only problem I have with this place..other than that it appears to be a great facility that the dogs can roam in..I just wished that they could be more honest when stuff happens.",0
"by far the BEST chocolate ganache and red velvet cupcake i've ever had!  The cupcakes were moist and the icing wasn't tooooo sweet, a perfect combination.  The decoration is ultra cute... this place may be the only reason i would stay at the Palazzo again lol",1
"Eh. This place is definitely not a destination for me when I go downtown and we only stop in when ... actually, I have no clue why we stop in. Maybe because we don't do Olive or Twist anymore?\n\nAnyway, the beer selection is ok, the bartenders I had last time were awesome, and the decor is odd. It's so sparse, I feel like something's missing. Like, the walls need \""""something.\"""" It's hard to explain.\n\nI have not eaten here and don't really have a desire to so I'll leave food reviews for others. I guess if everywhere else is packed, try here?",0

This place is great tried the Mille strawberry crepe cake and the strawberry shortcake. Wasn't too sweet just nice and delectable.  I would definitely recommend this place!,1

"#notmyredrobin. The chain has been going through lots of changes and unfortunately, not for the better. I used to love their wings and really thought they were some of the best around. And now, they are terrible! Opt for the Rib Tips instead. \n\nI'm not a fan of the smaller plates they serve the food on. Felt like my burger n sides were ready to fall off and no room for ketchup so I can dip my food. Also, I've been ordering the Keep It Simple burger for years and have consistently been served a juicy, well sized patty that is cooked right. However, on my last visit I received an overcooked, dry, small patty after I asked for no pink. This really did look like something you'd get at a fast food joint. Unfortunately, I'm done with this place and do not plan on returning.",0
"Tried this place for the first time and got the mini Maui chicken for lunch. Teriyaki is mediocre at best, chicken is not freshly prepared as if they took it out of the fridge and stuck it in the microwave for a few seconds. Salad is just a cheap head of iceberg lettuce chopped up. I should've headed down the street to Leo's Hawaiian and stuck to my usual.",0

"I'm a fan of this restaurant. I've gone here before for a date night and a girls' night out, and it was perfect for both. I love the decor, very modern with a touch of world flair and pops of color.\n\nTheir cocktails are amazing. The food is great. The service is friendly. The prices are a tad bit high for me to be a frequent customer but the ambiance and quality of the place call for the price range, in my opinion. \n\nAnd you certainly can't beat the free parking lot!",1
"What has happened to Mac's? Geesh! Saturday afternoon, ordered a tuna sandwich on multi-grain toast, little mayo, light on the sprouts. Half hour later, got a mayonaissy mess, no toast--just limp bread, bland as all getout, crunchy stufff in it. I asked the BF, does this taste like tuna to you? Turns out it was chicken salad. I hate chicken salad! Waitress offered no remedy at all. His steak asiago salad had a few grisly pieces of steak on some greens.  Both sides of the booth seats had gaping holes in the upholstery. Used to love going here, but never again!",0
"I was staying at the Hardrock Hotel and needed something I could order \""""To Go\"""" . Once I checked in with the hostess she advised that I should head to the back counter and someone would help with my order. I would say I went unacknowledged about five minutes. When I finally was greeted it was by a \""""busser\"""" who brought water. I let him know I was looking to place a Take Out order, he stated someone should be with me soon.\n\nI would say I waited another few minutes and was greeted by a waitress who took my order. I got small sirloin burgers, chicken strips, sausage gravy and biscuits and a side of fries. That totaled about 42$ which didn't surprise me for hotel food. \n\nMy issue was the fact that my Sausage gravy literally had NO SAUSAGE. The burgers were the only thing truly edible.The chicken strips were over cooked. \n\nI enjoy the variety this menu had to offer but the service was slow and many of the staff were standing around talking to one another instead of providing timely service. They even had someone not on the clock walking behind the counter.\n\nOverall the food was OK but I won't be going back again. Which makes me kind of sad because I really wanted to try this crazy hangover bloody mary they have on the menu.. It has a slim jim and deviled egg in it..haha",0
"fort mcdowell red rock buffet . i have been going here for 10 years and have noticed a big decline  in the food quality and employee workers. the workers are very rude and the crab legs steam section is in a very bad spot to stand in line for food. the freezer is located right in the standing line and you get shoved outta the way with super hot pans from the employees with a rude \""""excuse meee!!\"""" after being crammed in a corner by standing in a 20 min line to get crab legs i see the employees wiping down the food bar with moldy stinky rags and carlessly knocking old food into the fresh food. i was sickly discusted by these dirty workers with sweat pouring down there heads. i would not recommend to go here . and the crab legs have declined in quality. i don't know how people can continue to go here with such poor food quality and employees.  once you walk in it smells like moldy mildewy  rags and unsanitary environment . ive had this experience multiple times as i was trusting of the place i went to for so loong. and now sad to say its gone down hill and needs some good culinary management . i will not be going here again . finding a new crab shack until this one gets cleaned up .",0
"CAN I LIVE HERE?\n\nEverything is good. I mean everything. Chicken, pork chops, meatloaf, mac and cheese, sweet potatoes, greens, smashed potatoes, fried corn, cabbage, cornbread all completely authentic down home cooking. Try the chicken or pork chops cooked in any preparation fried, smothered, blackened or bbq and you will not be sorry. My favorite is the smothered chicken or chops, that gravy is so good. The atmosphere is clean and a little outdated but endearing with old school r&b and gospel playing. Great, friendly and fast service. You must try the fish stew. It is beautiful and spicy. Really good grits too. It is BYOB 3.00 corking. It's also a great place to bring kids and my 14 year olds favorite place. Go for breakfast and it a great place for Sunday brunch. If you keep an eye out you can find it on groupon and amazon local. If you have family coming in from the south this is a great representation of Pittsburgh soul food.",1

"I want to be clear that this is review is specific to the Nobu restraurant in Ceasar's Palace Nobu hotel, not the one in The Hard Rock. I assume the establishments are the same in their methods, however, since this is a chain. \n\nVerdict: Awful. \n\nI would give it one star, except I am feeling generous today, unlike the portions at Nobu. And to be fair, I expected such. What I didn't expect was a sub-par sushi experience for the price and the hype. \n\nThe hubs and I are VERY experienced Sushi diners and we tend to eat high end. We know our hamachi from our bonito. We don't generally do the Western dip everything in (fake)  wasabi and soy. We prefer sashimi, but explore the interesting world of inari maki, temaki, Japanese warm plates, etc...  BUT THIS PLACE!\n\nOur hamachi in sushi form wasn't fresh and the rice to fish ratio was off. Our seared (not mentioned on the menu that it is served seared) bonito was a little too seared and drowning in some type of nikiri that over-powered the fish completely. \n\nThis is to say nothing of what is supposedly Nobu's signature dish: Black Miso Cod. It is my understanding that he invented it, but I guess it has been perfected elsewhere because I have had MUCH better. Sushi Den in Denver comes to mind... The fish was just over-cooked to that point when cod changes from a delicate mouth-pleasing texture to a rubber tire. The miso sauce, however, was passable. \n\nAnd the service was awesome. Um. NO. I'm only kidding. One of our servers (we had more than one) asked us how we felt about the cod and we were honest that we'd had better, but it wasn't terrible. Guess what happened next? We were treated to a very snarky come-back. WOW. \n\nBottom line, we wound up leaving without ordering much more, spent too much (which we ARE ALWAYS prepared to do for a meal which is worth it) AND wound up having a great dinner at Gordon Ramsey's BURGR. \n\nYou want good Sushi on The Strip? I recommend Shibuya in MGM Grand over this place without a doubt!",0
"I came here with a group of friends on our trip to Vegas - there were 9 of us. The decor and service of this place is great. Our server always came back to ask us if we needed any help or recommendations. She recommended two alcoholic beverages (the Blood Orange Martini & the Bellini), both of which some got, but were NOT satisfied. Maybe our taste buds weren't up there, but it certainly didn't taste as delectable as our waitress made it seem. \n\nNext, we got the cheese platter which had everything from soft, medium and hard cheeses. Our server explaining the right way to eat the cheeses (with apricots, cherries, etc.). All the cheeses were delicious [it went great paired with the wine]. For dinner, I got the Penne Carbonara, which was pretty standard. It had pieces of eggplant and basil, which I thought was great. For dessert, my friend got the in-house gelato (vanilla bean & olive oil gelato). OLIVE OIL GELATO!? is probably what you are thinking, but some how the flavors work and it actually tasted like olive oil. It wasn't too creamy or heavy, it hit the spot :) \n\nAlso, at the end of our meal; the manager or someone that worked at Otto came and gave us complimentary discounted tickets for TAO nightclub (which is actually where we were headed after our meal). Overall, great service, decor & food. Check this place out when you visit Las Vegas next!",1
Definitely not what I've expected. \n\nThis place is works on first come first serve basis.  The line to get in stretches in the middle of a casino. And you're standing right In front of a bar which is okay but horrible If you can't take cigaret smoke. Got a headache while waiting. \n\nWhen you walk in its a small stage. Nothing too crazy.  \n\nThere were only 2 dancers that were appeasing and knew what they were doing.... \n\nOverall the show was monotonous and Boring.  I came here with 5 other people and they felt the same way.   \n\nVery minor acrobatic stuff. \n\n\nIf you've seen a$$ and tits before. Go somewhere else. \n\nThe only upside to this show is that they had a comedian come up on stage for about 5 mins to wake us up. Which worked.,0
THIS PLACE SUCKS! STAY AWAY!!! They lie about their loyalty program. Every time I play here I have argue with club house people just to get what they promise in their promotions. My hard earned dollar is going somewhere else. Not worth the hassle for lame course with very limited services. I recommend Angel Park much better customer service & golf experience.,0

Also the wait for your food can become ridiculous if it is busy which doesn't make and sense...cook some more wings pronto!",0
"Wow!  Served in a 3 ways is the Michael Mina way!\nI'm still savoring the taste of the froi grois that I had there.\nThe service was very good.  The team there was incredible! \n\nWe ordered a fancy shmacy wine from New Zealand to go with our oysters once again, froi grois, scallop ceviche, chiliean sea bass, and kobe beef.  I've never been to a restaurant that serves entrees for $40-$80 each.  That was a nice shocker for me.  But it was all good and one of my favorite dining experiences.\n\nI recommend going here with a high roller!  They'll make sure you'll have a good time!",1
"A $6 HIDDEN GEM ON THE VEGAS STRIP!!!\n\nI love toasted sandwiches....this is no exception.

I tried 3 sandwiches in one sitting (yup the best way to do it is split yours and trade with others). \n\nThe signature club was my favorite....Didn't like the roast beef and hawaiian all that much....but still loved that bread. \n\nYOU MUST GET A SANDWICH HERE!!!

"without a doubt the worst service I have ever received ... last night, Thursday Oct 24th, we arrived at the lounge which is absolutely beautiful ... a band was playing and they were wonderful ... we were three of maybe 20 customers in the entire place and we took seats at the bar. it took a good 8 to 10 minutes for the bartender to get to us although we were trying to get her attention ... she appeared to be a new bartender as she was searching for bottles and did not seem to know the location of things behind the bar.\nwe enjoyed our cocktails and listened to the band, after about 25 or 30 minutes I was ready for another cocktail, try as I may I could not get the bartenders attention, mind you, at this point there were maybe only 10 customers in the entire bar including the patio area ... I finally got the attention of the manager who came behind the bar and he got me a second cocktail.  during the time that he was getting my cocktail the band took a break between sets, when the band was ready to start the final set, it took about 7 or 8 minutes for them over the microphone to get the attention of the manager and bartender to turn off the house music ... at this point there are only 5 people in the bar who were all laughing because it was so funny that the band could not get the attention of the employees, the manager finally turned off the house music and the band began playing the final set, at this point my two friends were ready for their second cocktail and we again could not get the attention of the bartender or the manager ... we were literally waving our arms for a good 5 minutes trying to get their attention, I finally got up from my seat and walked to the end of the bar where the manager was socializing with the bartender and I asked him if I could speak to him for a moment to which she said sure and stepped from behind the bar to talk to me and I explained to him that although the bar was beautiful and the band was very engaging and wonderful that the service was absolutely horrible ... his response was, and I quote \"""" well then I think you've had enough and you guys should leave\"""", absolutely no apology for the poor service, just told us to leave, mind you, my friends were still waiting for just thier secnd drink and I was still enjoy my second. I absolutely will not be back and I will be contacting the general manager to discuss the situation. \nOn a side note, The manager on duty seemed to be flirting and making himself very familiar with the bartender. I did pay my $30 tab and tipped the bartender $5 ... even though the service was very slow, she was friendly and again it was obvious that she was new.  The managers attitude on the other hand was horrific and completely unacceptable.",0
"Meh, food was fine, but overpriced (even for airport food).

"Nice desert course with some great views, but in poor condition. Yes, I know it is summer in Arizona but this was in worse shape then other course I played the same week. It was also a overall bad experience.\n\nMy friend set up the tee time on line through the Raven's page, not some 3rd party company, and it was the Raven at Verrado page. Well, when we get there the lady has no reservation for our group, and other then admitting fault, tries to blame us saying we were the one to make the mistake. It wasn't until my friend pulled it up on his email which confirmed our tee time, and also showed the $10 that was put as a deposit. Yup, they took his $10 and still showed no tee time. When he asked where the $10 when the lady stated that she had no idea.\n\nLucky for us it was a Monday so we were still able to get on because they were not that busy. The first green should have been a sign of things to come as it was about 40% grass and 60% sand. This was par for the rest of the course. All of the greens were this same very poor condition. \n\nThe third hole was the biggest bust of all though. As one of my friends was in mid swing of his drive, a grounds man took off in a gator cart right behind him. If you don't know, those gator carts are LOUD. Then he drove up to the green and turned the sprinklers on. I just about lost my mind! Between all the years of golf my friends and I have, we have never seen anything like this.\n\nI am sure this was an isolated incident because Raven's are generally very nice, and I would like to play here again.

"Came here on a business trip and was happy to see that they had a nice looking bar and restaurant on site. Right away, however, I could tell it wasn't going to blow me away. The person I was sitting next to at the bar had their food come thirty minutes late and was audibly upset. My food was nothing to write home about and was still overpriced. It took way too long for the food to come out. The waitresses and bartenders were.., man, I really hate to say it, but they just didn't see, to want to be there, which made me feel the same.",0
I saw Bailey a few weeks ago for a 50's pin up style and she was amazing! Her along with everyone else there were all super nice. The environment was friendly and clean. I will definitely be going back!,1
Not impressed by this place at all. The bartenders were not friendly at all and the place looked like a dump. Not suprised since it was off Grand.,0
"Favorite burger joint on earth.  Spiked milkshakes and burgers with top choice cuts of meat.\n\nI always come here at least once when in Vegas.  Try \""""The Rising Sun\"""" just phenomenal.  The buffalo chicken dip is really good but it is simply too much food with the burger.  Don't upgrade on the regular fries... They are the best option.  \n\nInside the Cosmopolitan located across from the Marquee.  STK is an awesome steak house inside Cosmo check that out as well.",1
"This place is a true gem.  You owe it to yourself to give this place a try.\n\nThe Carlsbad Pasta is one of my favorite dishes in the entire city, and the Green Chile Burrito with their carne adovada is incredible.\n\nThey lose a star because you have to buy their chips and salsa.  That's the only knock I have on this place...it has become one of my favorite spots in the Valley!",1
"Travelpro makes some great bags, BUT the \""""Lifetime Warranty\"""" is worthless.  Don't be fooled; the \""""Lifetime Warranty\"""" has a very limited lifetime.  I paid a lot for a Travelpro carry-on and after several years the fabric at the bottom ripped.  It was not abused at all.  The local Travelpro service center said this was normal wear and tear and they could repair it for $85.  Really, repair a carryon for $85?  I contacted Travelpro directly and they came back with the same thing, specifically \""""If a bag has faulty or weak material it will reveal itself very early on in the life of the bag.\""""  I see, so the \""""Lifetime Warranty\"""" is very short.  I am totally bummed out.  Offering a \""""Lifetime Warranty\"""" then not honoring it is very bad business.  Next time I will buy a more honest brand.",0
"Disappointing! Those of you who cry \""""false advertising\"""" are right!  Our room was so small, we couldn't find anywhere to put our suitcases except for in the walking space. The room was clean but hallways/balconies outside the rooms looked gross and dirty (gum, stains, etc). We were told we had an \""""upgraded\"""" room when we checked in but when we checked out, they asked why we didn't get the suite (which is what we thought we reserved). However, those of you who like the place are right, too--the location is excellent and the park next door is nice. The pool is also nice and well-maintained. The staff, considering their predicament (dealing with people who have succumbed to the false advertising), are indeed professional. I feel sorry for them. It was too expensive for someone on a budget- it's just an Econolodge (actually significantly smaller than an Econolodge room of the same type) or something with a different paint job. I _might_ stay there again for the park-side location but the whole false advertising thing ticks me off so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.",0
"To start, I'm ONLY giving this place 2 stars because the service wasn't terrible. \n\nAlso, if more people in Phoenix reviewed we could probably avoid most of these overpriced robberies. \n\nI ordered a cocktail that was actually pretty good. Something with sparkling wine and muddled sage I believe. My Mom had a mango martini. That was also pretty good. They are apparently 'known for their martinis'. Though I find it really hard to believe that they're known for anything. \n\nAs an appetizer we had caprese. It was 12 bucks and came with four tomato slices that were not ripe, four pieces of impostor buffalo mozzarella and a flake of basil. Hands down the worst I have ever had. \n\nNext came the salads. These were made up of a few greens and half a tomato. Seriously? \n\nFor my entree I ordered a mixed veggie type pasta with oil and garlic. 20 bucks down the drain. My boyfriend had the 'special' which was Cioppino. It was 36 dollars and his stomach is feeling ever dollar of it. \n\nWe took our left overs because we just do that and don't want to be wasteful. On the way home the smell of it was so bad we had to pull over to toss it out. \n\nThis place is a crock. They couldn't get me to eat here again at fast food prices. \n\nFor 4 people (And only 2 cocktails) our bill came out to 180 bucks. What a rip off.",0
"Weird! For some reason a yelp review was removed in regards to Body English. Well, here it is again, in a nutshell. Body English S-U-C-K-S! We booked a VIP table with bottle service for $400 and a few hours later we were pushed out, so they could resell our table. We were never told there was a time limit, nor were we offered the opportunity to reserve it longer. When asked what was up, the manager, Mike, decided to use childish insults and call the ladies in our group liars. We told him from the start, we wanted nothing more than a simple explanation, but that seemed to piss Mike off more. Whatever!! Never again! Go spend your hard earned money somewhere else. Peace!",0

"The South Point Hotel is our favorite place to stay in Las Vegas.  Their Garden buffet is the only negative thing that I don't like about South Point.  We have tried their breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets.  Nothing tastes very good.  Why do we still continue to eat here??  Two reasons.....the prices are affordable (especially when we have a buy 1 get 1 free coupon), and everyone else in the family thinks the buffet isn't too bad.  My wife and I seem to be the only ones who don't care for the buffet here.\n\nThe quality and taste of the food is sub par and mediocre at best.  Even the desserts aren't too good.   A positive thing is that I do not eat too much so I don't feel guilty.  Another positive is that the staff serving us drinks and clearing the tables have all been friendly.  Still, we will only come here if we are with family.  If it just my wife and I, we will go somewhere else.",0
"I live just down the road from this place and go there for the convenience.  The service is absolutely awful in the car wash area.  They try to pressure you into adding add-ons to your car wash and they don't take no for an answer very well as a matter of fact they can be out right rude.  Then there's the chipped windshield guys hovering around trying to pressure you into letting them fix a tiny nick in your windshield, and don't try to say no to these guys or you'll get more attitude from them.  Well today was the last straw for me, I pulled my car up to the vacuum spot and got out and stood there waiting, there were only two other cars there besides mine, and young the attendant waited on them first and when he was done with them he turned and walked a way, I waited a while longer to see what he was going to do and he never even acknowledged me so I walked inside and stood inside looking out to see what he would do, well they vacuumed my car out and ran it through the car wash so I got a hold of the manager and let him know what was going on and got an attitude from him...I ended up with a free car wash but I would rather have good service first and foremost and this was the second time this kind of service has happened to me here that's why I'm boycotting cobblestone from here on out.  Enough is enough.  Join me in boycotting this place there are plenty of places close by to get a car wash and for that matter anything else this place sells.",0
"I had Christmas Eve dinner here with my parents. I'm not a huge fan of chains, but that's where my dad wanted to go.\n\nBoth of my parents ordered the soup of the day which was lobster bisque. I tried a bite and it was decent, kind of rich.  3/5\n\nMy dad ordered a full rack of baby back ribs. They were very, very tender and good. I wasn't in the mood for ribs, but after I tried his I wished I'd ordered the ribs. 4/5\n\nFor sides my dad had cole slaw (fine 3/5) and ranch beans (kinda sweet, okay 2.5/5).\n\nI had the salmon and shrimp picatta. It okay, but I wouldn't order it again. I didn't care for how the salmon was prepared and the sauce wasn't very flavorful. 2/5\n\nFor sides I had rice pilaf (good, nothing special 3/5) and creamed spinach (would not order again, didn't taste good and a major disappointment since it was listed as a \""""premium side\"""" 1/5).\n\nMy mom ordered the fillet medallions with bleu cheese and wild mushroom topping. They were fine but certainly nothing to get excited about. 2/5\n\nShe had the loaded mashed potatoes. They were pretty good and were the best of the sides that we tried. 3.5/5\n\nThe service was not great (2/5). The waitress was overly chatty and seemed kind of flustered or something. Also, she kept fanning herself when she took our order and told us she was having hot flashes, which I didn't really need to know. \n\nOverall, 2.5/5.  The only thing that was really good was the ribs. Of course, that's what they're known for. Definitely recommend getting the ribs if you go here. Everything else, meh.",0
He number of beers in one place is crazy sick.  You can get just about anything at this place.  The number of beers on tap are just waiting to be tried and guzzled.  For a beer lover this is the place to go on this side of the strip.  I make it a point to get there at least 2 - 3 times each visit.  Ate there one time and the food is also good.  The server will tell you what to pair with your food.  Great place.,1
"My experience at BRGR started shaky but slowly improved. First, we were put on a half hour to forty-five minute wait for a party of two (note, they only accept walk-in reservations). The restaurant didn't seem to be at full capacity; however,  we ventured to the neighborhood in order to try this burger spot, so we didn't want to overhaul our plans. #endrant\n\nOnce we were seated, I ordered the BRGR fries and a alcoholic milkshake (the Cupajoe). The fries were thick cut and soft - not quite to my liking. They were also covered in shredded Parmesan cheese which didn't work for me. The shake was where the night started to improve. The alcohol the used was a bit poignant - not strong but overwhelming in taste. Otherwise, the shake was decent. I enjoyed the alcoholic shakes at Burgatory more.\n\nThe night hit it off for me when we switched from a high table to one of the cozy couch areas. These areas are meant for about five people and are great for talking with a group while chowing down and watching the game on a multitude of screens (inclduing a large projector screen).\n\nThe high point was the burger. I ordered the shrooms burger cooked at rare. The rare is more like medium rare at other places which was perfect for me. It was so juicy. It came with caramelized onions, mushrooms, and a drawing mustard aioli. It was so sweet and savory. Just a superb all-around burger. I would certainly return for it.\n\nIn terms of the overall experience, I prefer Burgatory to BRGR, but I wouldn't discount BRGR for a good burger especially when you're in the area.",1
"Quirky.  Yummy.  YELLOW.  Sandwiches!\n\nThere are a lot of things I like about this place, yellow decor aside.  The interior is very utilitarian, with brown bags pre-labeled with the sandwich type you want with little check boxes to select with a red sharpie marker.  You take said marked up bag and hand it to the cashier and they make your sandwich.  \n\nThe things I really like about the sandwiches is that you can really customize the heck out of it with the add-ons, for the most part, being without an extra charge.  Most sandwich places are happy to offer you more this and more that for XX amount of money, but with few exceptions, it's all included.  \n\nAnother small detail I appreciate is that my sandwich isn't falling apart or soaked through with sauce halfway through my meal.  For reals.  \n\nThey also feature a wide array of garnishments and sauces and the like.  Caramelized onions?  A1 sauce?  Yes, please.  Hummus?  Whoa!  I keep wanting to try all these different sandwiches but I can't drag myself away from The Wicked since I'm mostly starving whenever I arrive there.  \n\nMy personal favorite, like most people, is The Wicked sandwich.  Five meats, loaded to the brim with additional condiments and it's always hot and delicious.  Very MANLY sandwich!",1

"I'm pretty disappointed to write this review as I LOVE every other Pita Jungle I've been to. However, as other reviews have stated, this location is really struggling. I've been a few times now and service has always been very slow. It was better tonight, but the food was the big problem. We ordered hummus and pita, and though it came out quickly, when passing the pita around we noticed one of them was soggy and covered in some type of pink/red stain. Turns out they put a paper towel in the bottom of the pita bin and we just literally got the bottom of the barrel that had been sitting on the towel. Not sure how sanitary it is to serve that. I ordered the lavosh shawarma wrap which I've had many times at other locations. This time, it came out with no sauce on it and I had to ask for the sauce. By the time it came out, the lavosh had dried out and the whole thing fell apart. Also, the side salad had no dressing on it, and I had to get a side of dressing for that too. My husband's also didn't have dressing on it. Overall, it was (another) really disappointing trip to this location. We have such high hopes because it's in our neighborhood, but both my husband and myself said we'd rather make the trip to other locations rather than come back here. I know they haven't been open that long, so hopefully they work things out.",0

I don't really know) \nand the shrimp scamp - delicious sauce and the shrimps were pretty large. \nDozen oysters (for mis amigos) - they were also pretty large in size and I'm used to (and confined) to the smaller ones. \n\nI will definitely be back to try the other concoctions that other patrons seemed to enjoy!",1
"I don't expect much when I go into a store.  The people that work her are less then that in customer service.  The guy that works at the counter has never said a Hi, Bye, Thanks etc.  Not one peep, not one smile, most of the time he's on his phone.  He doesn't have a beard so I can't even really tell if he's Muslim or not otherwise I would say Salaam Alaikum to him.  \n\nI ate once at the cafe.  Good prices but the samosa was crazy spicy, the biriyani was good and a good big portion.\n\nNot that great of selection of meat.  When I've been there they haven't had any lamb so I usually stick to chicken breast and ground beef.\n\nI did find a really good tika masala paste there so I can make chicken tika masala.  But it's very hard to find there, they are usually out or have to look through all the other flavors of the same brand and find one mixed in.",0
"I'M SO SAD. Earl of Sandwich has definitely downgraded from the glory it used to be!\n\nI came here on my last trip to Vegas, only to find out that Earl is now only a shadow of his former self. \n\nLet me interject with some background history: I frequented Vegas when I lived in Southern California. When I say frequent, I mean at least once a month. I know Vegas like the back of my hand: I can tell you what hotels are located where, and what time each of the nightclubs' guestlists close. I was very familiar with Earl's menu. Drunkenly slurring out an order for the Earl's Cobb wrap, debating over the potato salad in the fridge, with my heels in hand at 4 am in the morning - that was my THING!\n\nSo on my most recent trip, I happily approached the cashier at Earl's, announcing that I would like to order the Earl Cobb Wrap. This was what I had been looking forward to all night, post-clubbing. Not squeezing myself into a dress, not enjoying the live DJ performing at a million or billion dollar club or whatever, but shoving Earl's in my face drunkenly after a night of dancing. \n\nThen the cashier said the words that absolutely broke my heart: \""""We don't have the Earl Cobb Wrap\"""".\n\nI stared agape at him. The wrap that I had eaten loyally for 4 years straight on my every trip was GONE?! Just like that?! \n\nI spent a while in disbelief, drunkenly lamenting my sadness to Mr.Cashier before reluctantly ordering a Chinese Chicken Wrap and making my way down the queue. \n\nWalking through the line, I brightened up at the thought of at least getting my potato salad. I peered into the refridgerator. And my spirits plummetted once again. What was once a generous portion of potato salad (think 6 oz) was now 2-3 oz! The same applied for the yogurt parfait - it was half the size it used to be! And surprise surprise, the prices were still the same original prices.\n\nBy the time I get to the front cashier (where customers pay), I was one sad, drunken lady. I shook the potato salad in Mr. 2nd Cashier,'s face, demanding \""""WHY! Why did you make this smaller? What happened!!\""""\n\nMr. 2nd Cashier responded tonelessly (he was probably used to these reactions), \""""Corporate happened.\""""\n\nWhen I received my wrap, instead of the wheat pita bread Earl's wraps used to use, it was some stupid flour tortilla. Dry and definitely did not soften the loss of my beloved Earl Cobb Wrap. Bleh.\n\nAnd so, I shake my fist as I angrilly write this review. Darn you, Corporate, darn you! How dare you take away what was once magical about Earl of Sandwich!",0
"Great Cocktails. Friendly Staff.\n\nA great little unpretentious \""""grown up\"""" bar in the heart of the Plateau. All the bartenders seem really adept at actual mixology, and they're really friendly and social. I'd even recommend sitting at the bar and getting to know them so that they can get to know your taste in cocktails.\n\nThere's also a nice snack menu that includes fresh oysters because, well, it's supposed to be an oyster bar, so if you're into aphrodisiacs from the deep, you'll wanna check that out, too.",1
"The great thing about Wolfgang Puck restaurants is that they tend to be very kid friendly, this was the case at Spago where upon seating our waiter offered to take an order for our two year old since he was very hungry.  We started with chicken wing lollipops which were delectable and moved into a Mickey Mouse shaped pizza for my son, a salad for my wife and a meatloaf dish for myself.  Wolfgang is known for his pizzas, righfully so it was great, which comes from a wood fired oven gracing the bar and \""""patio\"""" poriton of the restaurant.  The meatloaf is a cannot miss!  I'm normally not a meatloaf person, but it was fantastic.  The dish is more of a hamburger than a meatloaf.  Bursting with flavor and finished with a potato puree as opposed to mashed hit the spot.  Save room for the housemade nutella and banana crepes!  We are looking forward to visiting again when we are on The Strip for one reason or another.",1

"I was very surprised to be this disappointed in a Hampton Inn. The air conditioning never achieved a comfortable level even after having it on all night and we were quite warm in the room. I also noticed my credit card was overcharged by 15% and inquired at check out about this and was told it was standard procedure for incidentals and would be credited back after our stay. I suggested they inform the guest upon check in about this procedure and the staff just gave me an odd look. Lastly, when I arrived to their full service breakfast an hour before the service ended most everything was gone. I understand cooked items would probably not be replenished but baked items, syrup for the waffles and cups for the juice were not either. On a good note the bed was very comfortable and we slept well. The oversized jetted bathtub in the deluxe room was very nice, albeit loud, but overall this hotel is overpriced for what it has to offer.",0
The good: decent service that's usually not provided at typical Indian restaurants run by FOBs. The location.\n\nThe bad: food safety is a big issue here. My boyfriend and I have been up all night vomiting since our dinner at the buffet last night. A quick research online shows that this place had been shut down multiple times in the past due to several violations.\n\nConclusion: avoid this place.,0

"Dangerous!!!\n\nOur meal was so so, had to send back the margarita, and we ordered lemon pepper wings that had virtually no lemon pepper on them.\n\nWhen we ordered dessert, I asked if the brownie had nuts, the server said \""""I'm not sure, but I know for sure the blonde brownie doesn't\"""".  I said sure.  It came out with a scoop of ice cream covering the whole thing so I couldn't see that it was filled with huge walnut chunks.  I took one bite, started to react and went to the bar to get water.  As we are trying desperately to get out of there so I can get some benadryl, my dad has to stay behind to pay the bill.  They took off my dessert that I couldn't eat and my mom's dessert. That was it.\n\nVery scary for a nut allergy to be told that something for sure doesn't have nuts.  My dad sent an email right when we got home and we haven't heard anything back.\n\nWe absolutely won't return and it's doubtful any of our friends will either.",0
"I needed (okay.. wanted!) to make some South-East Asian food this week, as cuisines of this area usually combine flavoursome and generally healthy ingredients to make something really rather awesome. A lot of this kind of food I can rustle up with local ingredients, but there are a few harder to come by items, which are far cheaper in Chinese supermarkets than those which can be found in Tesco. This is very close to Tesco too, nestled in an ally way. The shop is quite small, but does its job. It's handy having a place like this so close to where I live.\n\nI knew about Aihua, and I have strolled in a few times without any real idea of what I wanted to buy, and came out confused, holding seaweed snacks... Many products are very unusual, including mock duck, unknown meats and packaging which doesn't imply much to an ignorant eye (like mine). It's frustrating, as I am sure there is a treasure trove of ingredients in here, but I just don't recognize much! This is one of the many reasons why I am self-teaching myself Mandarin. That said, there are plenty of more obvious foods like instant noodles, the ever-popular pocky and hello panda Asian sweets, and some quintessentially Asian vegetables like pak choi and beansprouts. \n\nToday I sent my boyfriend on a mission to buy yeo satay and fresh tofu. Tofu is almost always cheaper and nicer in Chinese supermarkets. \u00a33 and I got double the quantity which I would have brought at Tesco (sorry Tesco, yes I am comparing you). Yeo satay is really amongst the best prepared sauces available. There are no weird ingredients or MSG, just coconut, peanuts, tamarind, cornflour, oil and spices. This is a good place to stock up on rice and noodles too.",1

"Was told to go somewhere else by the owner. Guess our business and pleasant attitude just wasn't serious enough for him. \n\nWent here because it had such great yelp reviews and thought it was the best place to start our wedding suit shopping 3 months before the big day!\n\nUnfortunately we were told that this is NOT the first place to go by the OWNER himself. Apparently he wanted us to shop around at all the other suit places so they could do all the work of having us try suits on and he could skip out on it. He wouldn't even allow us to try on a suit!!!  He said \""""It just takes so much time with people coming in and trying suit after suit on\"""". Man that poor guy owning a suit shop, who knew people would actually want to try them on? \n\nSo the customer service is non-existent unless you're willing to walk in and know exactly what you want right away.

We DID however take his advice and go shopping somewhere else... where we bought our suits... with someone that was willing to actually let us try them on!",0
"So I used to love this place when Brian worked there.  I heard he went to another shop somewhere in Tempe, but no one at Taylors would say exactly where.  I've recently moved to Tempe and my mom asked them where Brian went because it would be closer to me now.  They still wouldn't tell her.  I took my car in for an oil change.  When Brian worked there, he would check out the whole car and let me know other issues I should know about.  He also knew to use synthetic oil without my having to say anything.  Not anymore.  They used non-synthetic oil.  The kid behind the counter basically said it's my fault for\nnot clarifying.  So much for the customer is always right.  I'm pretty sure they didn't check out the rest of the car either.  I wish I knew where Brian went.  Most honest hard working guy ever.  I don't think I'll be going out of my way to come back to Taylors.  Why they let Brian go is a mystery.",0
"Things that might happen at Bikini Lounge:\n\nYou might watch your friends dance with a bum in front of the juke box.\n\nYou might drink far too many pitchers of PBR.\n\nYou might throw a fit when you realize it is cash only.\n\nThe Bikini Lounge is quite possibly the crappiest place known to man. I mean it's in a shitty neighborhood where you might die, doesn't take credit cards, and has only bags of chips for food. So why do I keep going back? because eventful things happen here. Don't go if you want to have a quiet night with a couple of friends and go home and go to bed. Go here if you want to show up to a bar full of low lifes, order pitchers of PBR until you and your friends are all sick, then go outside and forget where you are and turn left down Grand Avenue only to find out you are nowhere near home when you get to the burned down church on 5th ave and monroe and a bum asks you for money. After that, you'll get in a bike taxi/rikshaw and tell the guy you can only pay him in cigarettes and then when he agrees, have him take you to another bar, instead of home, and then you will be further than you were to begin with. When you finally do get home thanks to a caring homeless guy that actually does have money (you find this out because he has a car) and gives you a ride home.

We got their number from another friend who posted positive review on FB.....Thank you....the guys were very professional, pointed out what was wrong and how to avoid it in the future.  Will definitely use them in the future should any problems arise!!",1
"I have returned twice since my first review, and feel like I got a false first impression. Both servers I've had since, have been no help, and actually didn't even talk to me to see what I may need until after my food arrived. Bad service has really killed this place. \nBurger is pretty greasy/ messy, but tasty.",0
"Please don't send in the clowns. This has to be one of the worst cirque shows. What a waste of money. Lots of harlequin clowns in white making sqeeky noises throughout the show. Never funny. The ringmaster sings in Latin  I guess  throughout the show. Very boring. The acrobatic acts are tempid at best. Nothing notable, nothing memorable, and nothing you couldn't see at any carnival . Couldn't wait for it to end. The audience felt the same as the applause was luke warm. Of course, I have to mention that I spent well over an hour in line at will call at 1pm just to pick up the tickets with only two ticket agents available. The theater and scenery was beautiful, but don't waste your time or money.",0
"3 stars for their Bun Bo Hue.\n\nSo I decided to change things up a bit this time in Vegas.  Instead of the usual Pho after a long night of alcohol abuse, I opted for the Bun Bo Hue (NOTE: NO Pho Here).  Sad to say..it was a disappointment IMO.  The soup base was kind of bland, it didn't have the spicy kick.  There was a total of 1.5 pieces of pork blood?!? I guess that's ok in this case because it was quite dry and tasted like chalk.  \n\nHowever, the BF got a rice dish and it was pretty decent.  But, the reason they get 4 stars is for their Coffee!! It has a hint of coconut flavor, it's freakin YUMM!! \n\nCheck-in through Yelp and get their coffee for $2!!",1
"A low-end convention center.  I guess it's probably cheap for them to rent it.  Just kind of dingy all around.  It does the job, but not if you're holding any sort of high-end event.",0
"I was quite disappointed with this location because it did not have hamburgers on its menu.  Kinda silly since they have chicken sandwich and hotdog, etc.  I was also disappointed with my hotdog order.  I ordered a foot long hot dog.  The box it came in kinda made me giggle since it was so long...duh...foot long.  But when we got home, it was actually just two hot dogs in the box.  Ukh!",0
"This is a service based review.  \n\nThe staff kept trying to take my food right out from under me.  I ordered french toast and had eaten it, but I had also ordered a cheese plate to share and that was slowly getting eaten while we were chatting.  Eventually they still ran off with my plate while I was in the washroom.\n\nThe worst part is what happened with the bill.  I gave $40.00 cash for a $30 bill and sat forever while everyone else got their credit cards back to sign.  Where the hell was my change?  When I said something about not getting my stuff back she simply gave me a copy of the receipt.  I guess she thought I just needed it for reimbursement?  Finally, I just showed her the bill and said, I GAVE YOU $40 WHERE IS MY CHANGE.  She looked as me like, oh, you wanted change?  Really?  She was going to take a $10 tip on my $30 bill!  NO!  Of course I still tipped simply because there were other servers that helped, but this was a clear account of someone trying to take advantage.  If I hadn't gone up to her to let her know, very clearly, that I wanted my change, I never would have gotten it. \n\nThe food was good and seemed average priced for the area.  The french toast was good and the coffee was reasonably strong and they did a good job of keeping my cup filled.  The cheeses were good, but I think it was priced a little high for what I received.",0
"I'm not really one to complain but I have to say, this place was DISGUSTING!!!! I'm the least pickiest eater, I will eat anything and everything but I couldn't eat my entree which was enchiladas. The sauce was the worst thing I've ever eaten. This place makes Taco Bell look like a 5 star gourmet  restaurant. It's a nice comfy atmosphere and friendly staff the food is just horrible. The chips were even stale. A word of advice, if you want Mexican food this is not the place to get it",0
"Thought I'd stop in for some shave ice. Got the mango flavor with the azuki beans, mochi, and condensed milk. Service was fast and friendly and helpful. The ice was soft and not like a snow cone. The order was HUGE. It tasted pretty great and while I have definitely had better, I wouldn't rule this place out. It's a great alternative to Sno Ono on days that I don't want to look for their truck or when I'm in the area and need a cool treat!",1
Great place! They had us sample the meat prior to ordering so we would know how spicy we wanted. The food was excellent. Service was outstanding! Loved the salsa bar idea. You can try different kinds of salsa.,1
Right in the curve go too fast and you'll miss it....you order first and they bring it to you....ok I had the bbq sundae omg it was great all the wonderful flavors just melted in my mouth....it comes in about a 24 oz cup clear so you can see the layers I chose brisket add my meat oh my my....bottom is potatoe salad it had jalapenos and u think bacon then beans with links then brisket then top it all off with coleslaw can't beat that for $8. My bf food was a little cold so free banana pudding!!!,1
"Just by accident, I found this place. I went in to take a look around, I was greeted by a young salesperson and she was very friendly. I'm not the cook in my family, that job belongs to my husband, but I love tea! This place is full of spices and teas and all things related. \n\nShe gave me a little intoduction to the store layout and offerd me a tea sample, they had three to try, two hot and one iced. I tried only one black tea with hazelnut, it was very good!\n\nThere are plenty of teas, each split into categories. Each blend has a jar to allow for auromatic enjoyment. I selected three tea chioces and signed up for their email notifications to keep abreast of new arrivials. \n\nA truely fun shop, for me, a person who thoroughly enjoys tea, will bookmark this place and recommend it for those that feel as passionate about teas as I.",1
"My family and I have been to Roy's several times, and we usually go for a combination of the food and ambiance/service. Tonight, though the food was good, we were sorely disappointed with the latter. \n\nOur server did not smile once throughout the entire dinner, and he frequently seemed annoyed with us. I don't ask that servers are constantly cheerful, but this particular waiter's demeanor was sour enough to cast a cloud over the whole experience. He would ask the requisite questions, but always with a disdainful look on his face. He also seemed irritated that we didn't order any drinks, and he all but snatched our wine glasses away. \n\nSpecifically, a few other things stand out among the general attitude of displeasure he displayed. We ordered the mango streusel dessert (from the prix fixe menu), and he brought out a pineapple dish and called it \""""apple pecan... eh... thing.\"""" We didn't realize it was the wrong dessert until we dug into it, so we didn't say anything. Then, when it was time to pay, we wanted to use two gift cards plus a credit card to cover his tip. We had some confusion about how to do this, and he seemed really impatient when we asked questions. Then, when we said we would think about how we wanted to split things up, he backed away with his hands up and stomped away. Lastly, when we had paid and wanted to double check that we had properly written everything out on the receipt, he just snapped, \""""That's fine.\"""" Again, I didn't expect him to fawn over us, but considering that we were trying to tip him (generously, might I add, given his rudeness throughout the night), he could have shown a little patience or at least said thank you. \n\nI want to give the server the benefit of the doubt and assume that he was having a bad day, but it's really a shame that the good food and atmosphere were tainted by his unpleasant behavior. Next time my family wants to enjoy a nice dinner, we will probably choose a restaurant where we can expect a server who doesn't sneer at us.\n\n***\n\nEdit: The manager saw my original review (above) and called to get more feedback. This impressed me and showed that Roy's really cares about its customers, and Emiliano was nothing but courteous and understanding when I spoke with him. He even sent a $50 certificate for our next visit. I really appreciate that he reached out and will be sure to try Roy's again soon.",1
Best turn down service - the Housekeeping staff is fabulous from the mints to ice in the bucket when you come back.  The rooms are nice first time I had seen the tub on the other side of the shower stall.  The hotel  in general with the fresh scented air to the upscale vibe that doesn't leave you wanting a shower after entering would make this a fist choice on the next trip to Vegas.,1
"A great authentic Chinese restaurant. The Five Flavor Squid and Won ton Noodle soup with BBQ Pork, is as good as any I have had. Even compared to restaurants in the china towns of Washington D C or New York City. I have been coming here since 2005 and have tried most things on the menu. I haven't had a bad dish yet. \n\nThe service is prompt and friendly. It is a very casual atmosphere no need to dress up here. The food coming out of the kitchen is just good, real Chinese food.",1
We ate here on a Saturday night for our girls weekend in Vegas. We were all very excited to see what the 2 hot tamales are all about. We had reservations and were seated promptly in the upstairs balcony. This gave us a perfect view of the Train concert going on in the pool area and provided wonderful background noise. The guacamole was worth the extra money but there wasn't any spice to the salsas with the chips. If there was an alternative available it was not offered. I shared the Peruvian ceviche and sweet corn tamales with a friend. I loved the plantain chips with the ceviche and thought it was very refreshing. The tamales had wonderful flavor but was so wet it had to be eaten with a spoon. For the entree we had the seafood chile relleno. The pepper was nice and crisp with a very flavorful filling. Over all it was a very nice atmosphere and good service. I would definitely come back.,1
"Yummy chocolates and very nice staff ... love that they make the chocolates on site.  Nice selection of bacon chocolates & candies, too, for the more adventurous out there.",1
Ok this place is pretty cool with it's take on drug culture and basically turning a places normal entree into a pizza.  I have had most of the pizza's but what surprised me the most was their beer selection on tap and in the bottle etc.  They serve Abita Springs Turbodog which is one of my favorite brown ales.  When you go here don't just get the hawaiian pizza try the Yukon Gold Hot Potato pie or something you can get a hawaiian anywhere these days.  the sandwiches are quite good as well.  It's a little pricey for drinks etc but they do run a nice happy hour 3-6pm I believe.  They have a bacon martini it's belvedere and a strip of applewood smoked bacon how could you not enjoy a chain like this?  I have always had good service here and it seems to me like it takes a little longer than most places if you order a pizza.  Don't get me wrong they go the extra mile with the ingredients etc. but you wait for it.  Also if everyone gets a 10 inch pizza most of them are around 11 bucks.  It's worth it but the pizza and a few beers and you are looking at 25 bucks plus.  So again I recommend the happy hour but anyone who loves pizza and beer should make a trip to any of their establishments.,1
Newest addition to the wynn lineup. XS' indoor/outdoor design is consistent with the motif of Blush and Tryst. Great organization of tables and easy-to-navigate walkways. Check it out.,1
"I have passed by this place multiple times because my friend used to work at a restaurant close by. I have also wanted to try it, epecially since they do have HH! However, I'm not a steak fan nor do I spend tons of money eating out.  \n\nI had the perfect opportunity to go the other day for my friend's birthday. I got there exactly at 6 which was the reservation time. The waitress was very friendly as she asked us if we wanted any cocktails or appetizers (I get it, it's her job to upsell and ask.) However, we were still waiting on the rest of our late party.  \n\nFinally everyone arrived. My friend ordered the beef carpaccio which had balsamic vinegarette, and tasted sour. It had arugula on top. I loved the veggies, but not the sour taste of the dressing. We ordered our food at approximately 6:30, and did not receive it until past 7:11. I get it. We were a large party (we had 12 people). My friend asked for extra bread. The waitress said she would put it in right away. We did not get it until my other friend asked 40 minutes later. Now, I'm not a steak fan, so I can't give too much opinion on my steak. When our food arrived, she gave me brussel sprouts instead of the truffle mac and cheese that I had ordered. The waitress did fix that mistake and bring me mac and cheese. Someone in our party did not receive his steak. There were issues with that which you can read in other reviews.  Half of the steak was medium rare and the other half was medium. I had ordered medium. My steak was COLD! As though it had been sitting there for a while. Maybe it was because I ordered mine medium and everyone else ordered theirs medium rare, so they cooked mine first and let it sit? I don't know.  The mac and cheese was nice and hot, but it just made my steak seem super cold. \n\nThey cleared our table  and gave each person a small plate and said it was for dessert since it was a birthday. Our waitress brought out the check and gave it to the birthday boy. Uh... we asked for separate checks.  10 min later she came back and said we can't do separate checks.  So we would have to calculate the price with tax and gratuity and tell them how much to put on each card. What a HUGE inconvenience.  \n\nThe manager came up to us and was told us that he would take care of us to get us out. UH... YEA that's what we were trying to do... You guys had your strict regulation of not splitting checks. You think I wanted to sit there and ponder over how much I owed. I felt that was super rude of him because I felt like he was wanted to get us out of there and just get rid of us.  The dessert finally came out, and it was beignets that I read in other reviews that they received complimentary. They didn't even give us enough for everyone in the party, and why did they even need to give us plates?  Plus it took FOREVERRRR!  Like, it was free, so I shouldn't really complain, but it came right as the manager came over to say that he was going to \""""take care of us.\"""" \n\nSomething weird, when eating the appetizer, I didn't use my silverware, so when the waitress brought out the steak knives and forks, she took my napkin and silverware. Was she going to reuse? I didn't think much of it at the time, but I didn't have a napkin. Why the heck would you take mine?!? \n\nI'm not a fan of steak to ever come here again after the horrible service I had. The food was okay, but again steak is not my thing. I spent $18. I could have made my own steak and mac and cheese for way less and not experienced that.",0
"I passed by this place several times and was curious and stopped in for lunch one day. It is a nice clean place with friendly service. I had a chicken wrap with house dressing. It was a huge wrap, but not very tasty. I ate one third of it. The baked beans and potatoes salad were not very good either. I regret not having just plain chicken or ribs. They looked and smelled good. I'm not sure that I will go back because the television was on Fox News. I could never sit through that again. Public places should never have televisions on stations that may offend their customers. It would have been better to have it off.",0
This place has been around for years.... And I have been going for that many years!  BEST HAWAIIAN FOOD I've tasted here in Vegas.  Staff is SUPER FRIENDLY!!! As are All Hawaiians! Lol. But Loco Moco is AMAZING! Spam Eggs and Rice breakfast is yummy! Get lumpia.... Adobo fried rice omelette is amazing.... TRULY anything and everything you get you will love!!!,1
"I kept going between 2-3 stars but in all honesty, \""""I've experience better\"""".  I'm not a huge champagne fan so this may contribute to the low rating in addition to other factors.  I opted for cocktails that mixed champagne with other types of alcohol so that I wouldn't be totally biased with my distaste for champagne.  \n\nI had the Champs- Elysees which is champagne with strawberry puree...there was a glob of strawberry puree settling on the bottom and top of the glass which made it challenging to drink the actual liquid in the middle.  Whoever made it was heavy handed with the strawberries and might have forgotten to hit the \""""puree\"""" setting on the blender but rather hit \""""chop in to indigestable globs\"""".  \n\nI also got the Le Petit Fizz (blue curacao, vodka, champagne) - weird - YES, weird in a good way - NO.  I enjoyed the blue color of the drink but there was way too much vodka and that's all you could taste.  \n\nI actually like the decor of the place, but agree with the others in that Perle seems like they are trying to be more clubby than classy.  The music was so loud that you couldn't hear other people talk.  I asked the waiter (who was really nice) if they could turn it down and they did, but it was still loud in my opinion for a place that doesn't even have a dance floor.  \n\nI may be back, but you can bet it won't be my first choice!",0
We have been ordering from them for years. I had the fiery Italian  . I love their french roll. However this time I found  a piece of plastic in my sandwich and have not been able to contact the store,1
Just order from here! You will like it! They are great to deal with and always willing to go the extra mile. I got the sausage and it was fantastic. I love to see local places do good.,1
Very unpleasant experience here!!,0
"Clean restaurant, great service, great noodles....what more can you ask for from a Noodles & Company?  We enjoyed our meals and would visit again.",1
"Went here on a Friday night after my boyfriend's Christmas party. We were in search of something nice and stumbled upon this and decided to give it a try. \n\nIt was a pretty full house; we were seated on the tail end of a Christmas party who had a table to spare. The only downside - we were seated right next to the DJ booth, so conversation was a little difficult. When our waitress finally came around to take our order, we started with the spinach dip; it was pretty good, served with homemade pita chips. The serving of pita chips was off compared to the amount of spinach given. Luckily, when we asked for additional chips, they were given to us free of charge. For our main courses, I had the grilled chicken sandwich with fries (what pulled me in was the mango mayo listed in the description), and my boyfriend had the pulled porc sandwich with onion rings. In a word, I was disappointed; the chicken was overcooked and kind of dry. On the other hand, my boyfriend's pulled porc sandwich was actually quite good; it was flavourful, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. \n\nIn all, it was alright, but nothing I would write home about. I would have much rathered The Keg or even Baton Rouge, given the prices this place charges. Our waitress was very nice, but because they all look alike, it was difficult to get her attention. If you're in the area, I would opt for The Keg over this place.",0
"I will say this , initially me and my companion came 2 nights before and left because we got very bad service. In fact , we were sat down and people who were seated after us were served before us (and I'd love to know why). But we decided to come back and had a great time. I look forward to eating here again , and maybe next time able to give a higher rating. On holiday from Phoenix Arizona. My companion found this place on a foodie blog. We had spring rolls for an appetizer. Then combo dinner rice , with shrimp and beef , and a chicken platter.",0
"terrible!! i'm not a complainer, but they're service was the worst.\ni'm visiting from out of town. when i checked they're website to see if i was within delivery range, the zip code where i am staying was listed as somewhere that they would deliver to. an hour and a half later they called to say they couldn't find my address. i stood outside for another half an hour on the phone with the delivery person waiting for the food. when they still didn't show up another 30 minutes later i called the restaurant. they said that i was outside they're area and it would take an additional hour. i said that was fine, then they called me back and told me that they weren't delivering the food after all.\ni've worked in the restaurant industry for years and this is disgraceful behavior. i wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.",0
"Home of one of the best poured Tanqueray & tonic's I've ever had. Served up in a big heavy tumbler with a big slice of grapefruit. Marvellous.\n\nQuite a classy bar on George St that still welcomes the commoners in Edinburgh (see: me) with a big smile and very welcoming manners. Service was quick and didn't scrimp on quality and the bar itself was very well laid out and stylish.\n\nThe building itself is huge inside with grand mirrors and fireplaces along with low lying couches. Every room is different, through the back where the diners are (where we ended up after our mini reception for our friends 30th) has a lower light, darker colours and a more intimate feel to it, with the front bar being very open and bright.\n\nThe dinner was delicious too. We chose from a set menu, 3 courses for \u00a330. The salmon they buy in for this place is delicious, obviously with thanks going to the chef for cooking it so well.\n\nI had no idea this place was a hotel but now that I know and have seen the service and level of quality that they offer to all their guests (whether they are diners, drinkers or hotel guests) I would definitely recommend this place to any friends coming from a different city, wanting something a bit classier to stay.",1
"4.5 stars, really. The food and service are amazing. Seriously, the BLT is as big as your head, and if you close your eyes, it tastes like real bacon. Not for nothing though, I find that a lot of the place's sauces are overly-acidic. The magnificently-crafted Thai Rice Bowl is somewhat diminished by what I see as a saucing that should be slightly thicker, and a little more \""""peanut-\"""" Despite this, and no pun intended, this place is awesome sauce.",1
"I've enjoyed everything that I've tried here thus far. The triple decker grilled cheese and tomato soup is a must try, and the chicken tenders is probably one of the best I've tasted. Don't forget to leave room for dessert - the cheesecake is a fave. The service is fast and friendly; even at their busiest time, the wait was short. The only issue that I have is the lack of space between some of the tables. I've experienced having to sit at a table that was against a wall and in between 2 big parties where the backs of our chairs were literally touching each other. It's hard to really enjoy your meal when you can hardly move.",1
"I have no idea how this place has 4 stars on here. To begin with, I think the outside of the restaurant sets false expectations as to what you shall find once on the inside. The entrance of the restaurant is delightful with a beautiful patio, running waters, a mini lake/river, romantically lit up at night making it look like you are about to enter into a devine culinary experience. Once on the inside, the restaurant is dark and dingy, divided into two parts: a bar area with enormous booths, and a dinky room with fake wildlife where more booths and tables are. We were lucky enough to sit by the dinky wildlife/fake mountainside/faux cave where there were still last years halloween decorations up. My personal favorite was the bats. And to top it all off, it was incredibly dark in there, adding to the dark and dingy halloween theme they have going on.\n\nIf the ambience isnt enough to kill your appetite, the food sure is. We got two entrees: steak tacos (from the appetizers section) and a trio platter (one of the supposed \""""favorites\"""" according to the trippy waiter) with the chile rellenos, enchilada, and burrito. Lets start with the steak tacos: personally I think Taco bell tacos are superior to what I ate. The steak inside was cold. On to the platter: first of all you could not physically distinguish which was which without the help of the waiter pointing out each item due to the amount of sauce on top of the whole dish. Better yet, my taste buds couldn't distinguish the difference between each dish because it all just tasted like generic mexican flavored mush.\n\nUsually yelp reviews and star ratings are really legit, don't know how this one has escaped that. You're better at off at Taco Bell.",0
"Based on reading reviews from Yelp, I picked this florist to send flowers to someone in the local area who has been dealing with an illness.  On a positive note: the recipient said the flowers were gorgeous and had never seen such a beautiful arrangement and variety of flowers.  On a negative note: I did not feel that the store had very good customer service.  The first time I called to place my order, the person who answered the phone basically told me she was too busy to talk to me because she was the only person there.  So I ordered online off their web site.  The next day, upon calling the store, I found out my flowers were sent out without any confirmation phone call or email detailing what exactly was being sent and the final fee with the delivery fee (for being outside the delivery zip code).  I was unhappy with this aspect and told the store owner such, and he refunded my delivery fee.  You can't just run through a charge on someone's credit card without giving them a final amount.  Overall, glad the flowers were superb but this store could benefit from improved customer communication/service.",1
I usually like the pizza here. When I called for delivery I chose this location because it is the closest one to me (7min drive). When they told me that I they wont deliver to me because they aren't the closest Pizza hut I was confused. The other two locations are 13 min way and 12 min away. Does anyone understand this logic?,0
"I honestly don't even know where to begin. We ended up at Akita tonight based on yelp reviewers stating that it's $11.99 all you can eat Sat-Mon. It was a toss up between Geisha's awesome Sunday specials and this. We decided to give someplace new a shot...\n\nWe sat down, all you can eat dinner menu in hand, no prices in sight, conveyer belt not on.. We ordered a few spring rolls, edamame, the pork cutlet, and a seaweed salad. The only thing that made it out was the salad... When it came to the sushi, every roll that should have been cold was warmer than room temperature (still crossing fingers that we don't get sick). I decided to try and order some appetizers again.. I ordered two spring rolls, two scallops, a calamari tempura and a shrimp tempura. We eventually got ONE spring roll, ONE scallop, and shrimp tempura... No calamari in sight. Okay... Wanting to at least end on a sweet note, we ordered the fried bananas and vanilla ice cream. My thought was to eat the fried banana WITH the ice cream, however, the bananas came out about 10 minutes after the ice cream, therefore, that was already demolished. \n\nI felt that even with all of the screw ups, it was almost decent enough to be what I thought would be a $24 bill for two people. WRONG!!! To my surprise, dinner is apparently $19.99 a person, which nearly doubled my expectation. Knowing that I could have had an amazing meal at Geisha for half of what I paid is still not sitting well with me. \n\nIt is also worth noting that nobody that works here seems to know what they are supposed to be doing. We had three different people taking our orders, which probably explains why we didn't get half of our food. They should really think about giving customers an order sheet/pencil like most other sushi restaurants. It would probably make it much easier on the employees and give the customers a better experience. They should also, perhaps, post prices somewhere. Even if it's just on the big white hand written poster boards taped all over the building advertising the all you can eat special. There was no place to verify prices since there is no website either. \n\nIn conclusion, Akita really needs to get their sh*t together if they want to stay open. We definitely don't plan on going back anytime soon... If ever...",0
"This is my favorite resort  in the US.  I love the history, the grounds, the spa, the food...literally an oasis of everything I love.  I've stayed here several times in the past ten years and have never been disappointed.  The rooms are large casitas with their own patio and all the amenities one would expect in a room at a five-star resort.  The breakfast buffet is the best - without exception - I've ever had and my husband is always referencing it to others - literally 'In all the world, only one.'  I'm a huge fan of spas and theirs is the best in this category as well.   The adobe clay purification wrap is my very favorite treatment at any spa I've ever visited.  Afterwards, laying at the pool reading a novel after having their wonderful spa services is literally a slice of heaven.  Sprouts' food (the spa's restaurant) is pretty tasty as well",1
"The ambiance and service at the restaurant were very good. Appetizers were good (sun choke velour and beet salad), however the pork chop entree (ordered medium well per server recommendation) came out charred and tough. I was long finished my entree (duck) before the new pork chop was brought to the table. I was a little disappointed that we were offered dessert wine (not great) instead of having the entree taken off the bill. Once the new pork chop was presented, it was cooked well, but we were both underwhelmed with our meal and would suggest that there are other restaurants in Arizona that have better food at cheaper prices.",1
"So I was introduced to this station about 6 months ago by a fellow yelper who goes by Amy D... She has a wicked 8-10 spot on Tuesdays and I thoroughly enjoy listening to it on a weekly basis. Well, I was happened upon an opportunity... Nay! A priviledge of being a guest on this FABULOUS show and, being the attention whore that I have been labeled, I accepted.  I won't go into HOW I found myself being handed this prestigious title of KWSS Guest, but it involved a House of Clubs, Twitter, and a whole lot of begging (on my part)...\n\nThere I was... in the presence of 100% pure, raw (Can't decide which word to use \""""Talent\"""" or \""""Creativity\"""") and in a pretty bad ass studio. The Fabulous Amy and I discussed all the important topics of the nation/world and stumbled on numerous great ideas. One being a cure for cancer! Okay, we didn't discover a cure per say... but we did briefly talk about it.\n\nThe listeners were top notch and the atmosphere was professional, yet extremely comfortable. Plus, we actually got some free talent from a caller! He was awesome and sang me happy birthday.  It was sexy.\n\nThanks for a great time, Amy and KWSS! You rock, alternatively!",1
"Near perfect.  The rooms are so nice, you never want to leave.  The pillows, the mattress, the comforter... I feel like a fattened grizzly bear, bundled up and hibernating in a plush cloud.  People have posted plenty of pics, so you can see for yourself.  You could totally live out a James Bond fantasy; pick up a tailored dinner jacket from the Brioni store down the corridor , then have \""""hot girls delivered to your door.\""""  Or have your amateur porn shoot.  Or a romantic tryst with your significant other.  Yes, the room is pure SEX.  I could just feel that vibe, as I looked out the glass wall at the fantastic view of rubble and construction which was once the Stardust.  And yes, they do charge you for the emergency adult kit equipped with lubricant and condoms.  You can find it in the snack tray next to packages of M&M's and Reese's Pieces.  Some might give points for the wall of a mirror by the bed, so you can watch you and your partner in intimacy... or you might give minus points for the feng-shui faux pas (mirrors facing beds incites fighting and possibly cheating for people in relationships).  \n\nLuckily, your giga-glass window is tinted and difficult to peer in, but if you're still feeling shy, the controls on the nightstand can electronically  close the veil or bring in the thick curtains.  \n\nAnd even the restroom, showering and grooming never felt so fun!  There's some soft bathrobes hung ready, as well as a digital scale so you can keep track of the body weight you gained from last night's binge on booze.  And there's a phone by the toilet! In case you've fallen and you can't get up.  A small Sharp LCD TV in case you want to watch TV while taking a bath or brushing your teeth.  \n\nThe service is mostly nice, and they were willing to check me in early at 10:50 AM, instead of the usual check-in time of 3:00 PM.  But the guy who gave me the room told me the wrong room number~ I had to check back to get the correct room after trips of carrying luggage up and down 16 floors.  \n\nAt check out, the gentleman helping asked if I was satisfied, and of course I told him I enjoyed the room.  With a smug attitude he replied, \""""well, good for you.\""""  Interesting response... goes without saying that the Encore is pretty fabulous, kinda unnecessary to act like the king of his small mountain position.  \n\nAnd the wedding salons at Wynn have an understated elegance.  Sure, if you get married on a Cruise ship, you'll be married by a bonafide sea captain... a peglegged/eye-patched sea captain, but you won't get comfortable seating for 60.  I should know, I used to work on a cruise ship, speaking for seminars in the wedding salon where the chairs were dinky things, with people standing while the room attendance exceeded 30.  Okay, the minister probably won't have a parrot or pegleg, but you'll be married in a nice, non-seasick inducing surrounding.",1

"My family and I have been patrons of Richardson's & the Rokerij for over 10 years. The service has always been so so, with condescending waiters, etc. but the food usually made up for the bad service. I mean we even returned several times after my sister found a rubber band in her pasta Heidi and still had to pay for the dish. However, our past few experiences have been sub-par. Service is worse than ever and the food does not make up for it anymore. It is either too spicy or severely overcooked and dry. It will be a while before we return!!",0
I love these guys!! The food is great and the people running it are awesome!! Good folks and good Food!!,1
"I don't dole out 5 stars very often, and even rarer for only having one item off their menu--but it's worth your time and money to come to this food stand if you're a UW student, staff or faculty member.\n\nThe food is fresh, good, and healthy without sacrificing anything on taste. The woman who took my order today was lively and nice--exactly what you'd want your service to be like.\n\nI had a honey mustard chicken wrap and it's a very simple dish. Literally, just some lettuce, some cucumbers (or pickles--couldn't tell the difference), and some chicken with honey mustard in a wrap. But the wrap was a good portion size (especially for $5), filling, and delicious! The chicken was incredibly moist and tender, which made it all the tastier.\n\nI'll most definitely be back. Especially as someone who wants to lose some weight, Good Food is great for that quick to-go food without feeling guilty.\n\nJust a head's up though: Good Food only takes cash and is open from 11am-2pm. But if you can get in during that time, sosososo worth it.",1
"Review number 400.  A milestone review because of it's number but also a special review as it was not only one of the best Jewish deli sandwiches I have had but the last meal I may have in quite a while with one of my friends who is moving away and have shared many meals with.\n\nComing in at mid afternoon on a Sunday we were seated right away and our service remained top notch the entire time we we here.  Unlike most delis in the valley this is a full service restaurant and is priced a little higher.\n\nWe shared a chopped liver plate which came with bread, onions and some other stuff.  It was good.  She had brisket and I had pastrami and corned beef on challa bread, which she had suggested to me after our last Jewish deli outing. I had planned on Sweet Republic afterward and no way was that going to happen.  All of our food items were great!",1
"I must have missed something the other reviews got about the Squirrel Cafe. Granted, we stopped in for lunch on Saturday so maybe it is more interesting in the evening. It struck me as a diner with a bar in it. The food was mediocre (homemade cheese dip is not cheese you put in salsa and melt in the microwave) and the pepperoni roll, while good, was tiny. Beer selection in bottles was good but the draft selection was limited. The Squirrel Cafe seemed like a little mom and pop place. Character can only get you so far. You need to have a reason to come back and, for me, neither the food or the beer selection was enough.",0
"Hahaha. This place is a joke. A \""""Irish\"""" pub themed bar with way overpriced beer, girls in tiny outfits and cheesy 80's music playing in the background.  They don't have drink specials and the cheapest beer is $5 for a 20oz of Miller High Life or Bud Light. Lame. I think flirting with the creepy old dudes is in the waitresses job description. I honestly felt really bad for them. Oh and all of this while Wang Chung played in the background.  Bad. Bad. Bad.",0
"There are a couple of choices when it comes to ordering at L'Atelier; you can order a la carte, or one of their two dining menus (one is six courses for $95, the other is nine or ten for $145). We ordered both dining menus to get a taste of everything. \n\nThe food at L'Atelier is definitely at the top of its game-- our amuse bouche was some kind of foamed foie gras. Absolutely mindblowingly ridiculous. Some of my favorite dishes were the onion tart, the mussel soup (which has no mussels at all!), the quail stuffed with foie gras, and the mashed potatoes. Like others have mentioned, the potatoes are really, really tasty. It has an almost fluffed texture-- very creamy and silky. Plus, if you get the truffle version, it's really that much better.\n\nFor the 6 course tasting menu, I had the option of trying an assortment of tarts or housemade ice cream. Of course the tarts, right?! Out comes 5 mini slices of tarts, which tasted as good as it looked! The other menu had a champagne infused coconut gelee, which had a strong champagne taste. I also ordered a raspberry mojito that was very good too.\n\nOverall it is a must-try if you have the time and money to do so!",1
"Well I hate to be the first one to write a bad review, but with how much they wanted for repairs on my truck was ridiculous. I went to Howies based on the reviews on Yelp. I told them what I thought was wrong with my truck, but I did this to see if they would go along with it. Next thing I knew they agreed with what I said and gave me a labor quote for $1200, but 2/3 of the repairs they quoted weren't needed at all; those were the $$$ ones.  So I took my business elsewhere and had my truck good as new for $175 in labor.",0
"For a 3 star place, you couldn't possibly ask for anything more. \n\nWhile I definitely wasn't looking to stay at the Ritz Carlton I did need to a hotel that was clean, comfortable, and offered a great location at a reasonable price. We stayed during the week before labor day and paid less than $100 a night. \n\nI can't stress how great of a location this is. It's right by UQAM (what seems like a fairly large university) in the Latin Quarter so there are a lot of young people in the area - which also means a lot of fun bars and restaurants. It was really convenient both in the morning (when you're starved and need to get something before you make the trek to wherever you're sightseeing) and at night (when you really don't want to walk too far just to grab a cold one). It is also located about a block from one of the metro hubs where you can pretty much jump on any of the different lines. \n\nThe room we stayed in had one queen. It was a pretty comfortable size for two people. It was also very well kept - a little outdated, but spotless with a very comfy bed.\n\nWhile we didn't interact too much with the employees, they always greeted us in a friendly manner and helped out with whatever few questions we had.\n\nNote: It seems the most \""""tourist-y\"""" part of Montreal is the Old Montreal area. That may be better for families, but I think this area is much more convenient and interesting to couples/friends traveling together. If you do stay in the Latin Quarter, definitely choose the Hotel St. Denis.",1
"It's been too crowded here lately. Driving around for 15 minutes looking for a parking spot is frustrating and impractical. It's time to add another gym on the south east side, LVAC.",1
Thank You to the random group of guys who shared their very tasty pepperoni pizza with us as we staggered out of Marquee at 2 am.. The line looked crazy long and they said they would rather share it with us then their friends waiting in the room for them (and the two pizza's) \n I Love Vegas !,1
"Just came back from the 3 days to the Isle of Skye with Euan. It was fantastic and Euan knew everything and talked about history, myths, interesting facts, geology, etc. We were amazed at the amount of great information he offered. Really funny too. We stayed a the Rosedale Hotel In Portree, Isle of Skye, charming hotel which was right in the harbor. \nWould do Rabbies again for one day or multiple day trips. Buses are comfy, new and clean. Aliwot also seemed like a funny, interesting, informative driver. We ran into his bus which was doing the same tour.\nGreat value and if you want to see the countryside without the hassle of a car or train, this is the way to go. You get more info too!",1
"Worst service I've had in years. Our waitress disappeared for 30 minutes while our food got cold waiting for her to serve it. Then she had the nerve to add the 18% tip because we were a party of 7. Even though we were staying at the hotel and it is convenient, we will definitely not be going back.",0
"Don't put huge chunks of carrot in my sushi as filler! That was just the beginning. The sushi all tasted the same. One roll had the same taste as the next, mainly carrot and more carrot. While this would be a fantastic value, the sushi just wasn't fresh, flavorful or memorable at all. Service was ok. All the reviews say it comes with other stuff but ours just came with salad and soup, no appetizer or ice cream. The sake was good but not great, the other times I have had it, they were really smooth and good and this just wasn't. I am by no means an expert or know one sake from another but this was not like the other ones I have had. I wouldn't go back here on purpose. There is a lot better tasting stuff around. We tried about 5 different rolls and a couple sashimi and nothing stood out.",0
"When I was a kid, I loved going to hometown buffet at least back then the food was awesome! last year, my mom and i went there the food was great. we went there yesterday evening for a late bday for her and the food was freakin nasty! something i ate made me go to the bathroom almost twice!\n\ni noticed the seating was very low not that many customers. the bathroom (womens) was horrible! there is one lady who looks new is super friendly with long hair in a ponytail. she goes above and beyond not so much the other staff will do that. i don't know what is going on with hometown buffet but it looks like they don't care. i agree with someone on here said the cooking speaks otherwise!\n\ni couldn't finish my 2nd plate of food it was that bad the only thing was good is the dessert. i hate to say this but i would rather not go to hometown buffet anymore.  i dont know why my mom chooses to go there (oh wait its cheap) but there are better restaurants.\n\nin 96 or 97, my parents had their sphagetti and it made them sick! the food didn't do anything to me. i told my mom why go back when it made you sick? makes no sense to me.",0
"Came here on Friday night. After a long drive from San Diego we were starving.  There was no line which was great!\n\nI have eaten here a couple years ago and remembered it was delicious. I was very disappointed this time around. The crab legs and cocktail shrimps were frozen cold. The fish was dry and had no flavor. I am a big desert fan and they did not have a great selection of choices.\n\nThe waitress who was serving us was very unprofessional.  She was cleaning the table next to us and was talking crap (very loudly) about the amount of tip the previous people left. I couldn't believe it! She not only did it once, but twice.  \n\nI would not come back. Definitely not worth it.",0
"The staff here politely ignores you. \n\nI went in for lunch one day with my father and we hadnt received our meal in over an hour. We had to get the waitress or hostess attention for everything, drinks, apps we had ordered (seems that they forgot), bread........it took an hour. You figured theyd bring this stuff out as a courtesy. \n\nThe manager was the worst. She trolled the restaurant the whole time and when she saw that we were looking to her to come ask how we were doing, she would make eye contact and keep walking. I saw her escape into the bar several times. Maybe it was to avoid having to look the patrons in the face. \n\nEither way, the food was average, the wait was terrible and they werent that busy.",0

"Hana is the only Japanese restaurant I will eat sushi in Phoenix. Their prices are quite reasonable, and the quality and freshness is always exemplary. I dine in sometimes, but I often get it to go, since I live nearby. It's pretty busy in the nights, especially the weekend. \n\nThe nigiri and sashimi are my favorites on the menu. My usual run to Hana includes eel nigir, tuna sashimi, yellowtail sashimi, and sometimes salmon sashimi. They are very generous on their cuts of sashimi, and I don't feel ripped off as I have at other restaurants with paper thin slices of fish. They are always mindful if you have any food allergies and will ask you up front if you have any. So all you lactose-intolerant folks, definitely check out this place. \n\nExpect to pay around $40 for a nice amount of sushi, but you will leave satisfied and know you're paying for fresh and great quality food.",1

"Have again: the Philly sandwich was actually not bad because the bun was delicious and the meat/onions was good.\nNot have again: the bacon/cheese fries were marred because of the cheese, which of course is not really cheese. Service was not very good since I had to remind them that they still needed to give me the fries twice.",0
"Food is pretty good, but major problem with service. When we dined there, it was severely understaffed; only 4 workers were working the floor, covering all the tables. Some dishes needed to be cooked at the tables so that further limited the service. We had to wait 20+ minutes after sitting down before ordering.\n\nServing sizes were generous but they were very stingy on the rice. When we asked for more, the waiter let out a large exasperated sigh before complying. Quite unprofessional. When we asked for more water, again with the exasperated sigh. So sorry for inconveniencing you! \n\nWe ordered our dishes with white rice, but when our food was brought out, we got red rice instead. We told them we ordered white, but they said that they were out and red was all they had and left it at that.\n\nYou have the option of having meat grilled at your table on a portable stove, which is nice, but after they brought the stove out and lit the fire and poured oil in the pan, they left for around 15 minutes. In addition to the increasingly hot oil that was sitting right in front of us, the pan was leaking oil over the open fire and the table. When this was brought up, they brushed it off saying it was okay. They never cleaned up the oil on our table.\n\nAfter we finished our meal, we waited quite a while for our check. Eventually, we were fed up with waiting and we got up to go get someone to bring us the check. When the check arrived, we quickly threw in our credit cards and set it to the side of the table (cards sticking out, easily visible) and proceeded to wait another 15 minutes before they came back to pick up the check. After that it was a good 20 minutes before we got our cards back.\n\nTL;DR Food is good, but service is atrocious.",0

"I always used La Village at Paris when I'm in Vegas. But after few peoples' recommendations I decided I have to try Bellagio's. It was total disappointment. \nDon't get me wrong. Food was not bad. It was fine. Same baked potato I can bake at home, same over-baked salmon I can over-bake at home. Some deserts were really nice. But here is my problem. We have it all in local LA buffets (like Hokaido) for half price on daily basis (including seafood). At Paris you at least have the nice settings of sort of French village. While Belagio buffet is just a huge eatery. \nSo again food is OK\nOverall food/price/place - never again",0
"My husband, my friend and I  wanted to enjoy our  New Year's Eve dinner at this restaurant since we've heard great things.  Unfortunately, it was all but great.  None of the personnel, with exception of the water waiter, was carrying a smile on their faces. We placed our orders and realized that our waiter named Aris never asked my husband how he wanted his $63 file minion done, not to mention that it arrived in a very pathetic looking form... it was dry and tasteless and we almost thought we are the wrong place.  He also very arrogantly replied to our question when we asked to share an entry - saying that it is the busiest night of the year and guests must order full entries.  When he brought our wine and mineral water for spritzers, he literally said: \""""here you go, please mix it yourself, because I don't know how you want it\"""".  Not to mention that we felt very rushed as they were taking our plates away.  And then, we did something we have never done before:  we tipped the water waiter and told him that he was the only nice person in the restaurant and we left zero tip on a $207 bill for Aris.  I hope the Gallagher's management reads this review and does something to improve...in the meantime, we will continue going back to the CircusCircus Steakhouse that never failed us.",0
"Went here because they were selling ground chuck for $1.99 a pound and wanted to stock up. Did notice the parking lot was packed so I thought it must be OK inside. WRONG! It said they were in the process of renovating the store so I let a few things slide. What really stuck out to me was the fact that the place seemed cluttered and unorganized. The butter was near the beer while the bread was all the way on the other side of the store. Also when the employees stand there and make  loud and nasty comments about customers that should tell you something right there.\n\nI spoke to someone in customer service and they seemed unfazed, like oh well!! I know if someone was talking crap about my grandma I would be taking care of that issue myself. I do not shop at this chain and for good reason. Over priced and the stores always seem to be dirty. I suggest saving your money and going some where they really act like they want your business.",0
"On the account of my friend's recommendation we visited this restaurant today, Dec.27,14 on a Saturday evening. We missed our old buddy Restaurant, 1900 on Spring Mountain Rd which was closed and decided to venture out for a new Shanghainese restaurant. There are 6 of us, 4 adults are all familiar with Shanghainese food like XLB, drunken chicken etc..We are not looking for the delicious Shanghainese cuisine in Shanghai or Taipei, we just want to have a decent meal of Shanghai style.\n\nI was quite impressed by the ambience and all the elaborate and appetising pictures on the manual, but unfortunately that were all they are good at.\n\nThe XLB has strong porky odor to it and there was no soup inside the wrapping. All the cold appetizers like jelly fish, drunk chicken, 3-yellow chicken, bean with Tofu paper are completely different in their look compared to that of the pictures, they must have been in the fridge for days. The chicken were chewy, not tender as one would expect. The jelly fish was very salty.\n\nOf the 4 entries, the fish belly in soy sauce was barely deserve a passing score. But it was not belly at all, it was entire fish without the head. All the others were just put together by an amateurish hands. Shanghainese food are known for their harmonious blending of the soy sauce, wine,oil,sugar together with various food content in hot temperature the bring out distinctive flavor and taste, here in our mouths they are completely disintegrated, let alone taste good.\n\nThe service was slow and disorganized. One can easily notice the short staff help. And I wondered what might happen in the kitchen. The last dish, the eggplant stew was waited for 15 min after we finished all the food before it appeared on our table. Waiting for the bill to be calculated was another 15 min wait.\n\nAll the glasswares pile up on their bar table to be distributed for take out or for serving drinks. That table is supposed for sitting and for show since they do have liquor licence. The bathroom ran out of soap liquid and the hand dryer broke...\n\nI hope they just had a bad day with the chief chef on leave and we just happened to be there on the occasion. I sincerely hope they can improve in the future.",0
"Why is it that every time I go into this joint, it's like Amateur Hour at The Apollo? I am so over going into joints, and leaving feeling like I was taken in a weird slight of hand game. \n\nThis place is so over-rated. How does one order off of the Happy Hour menu, and leave with a $70 bill. For 2.5? Me, GF, and 5 yr old. \n\nWe went here for a great fun time with cool peeps, and were there 2 hours. Wing Tuesday is really not that good of a deal, and the Happy Hour beers are junk. \n\nSorry for the rant, but, Buffalo Wild Wings, I am over you, and we need to end our tepid relationship.",0
"People are calling it \""""pricey\"""", but compared to the same quality meat you would buy at a grocery store I've found Hobe is actually LESS expensive.  Consider there are different scales of quality, Prime being the best.  I don't even think you can get Prime cuts at Safeway and other markets.  AJ's and other high-end markets sell Prime beef and is more expensive than Hobe.\n\nNext, get your THANKSGIVING TURKEY at Hobe!  Best possible quality and not all turkey's are the same.  You won't regret it.\n\nLastly, I get my dogs their bones at Hobe.  They cut them to best fit the size of your dog.  I keep them in the freezer and give them to my dogs frozen.  They work on those bones for weeks.\n\nThanks Hobe!",1
"GREAT BBQ joint!!! Very hard to find, it's tucked away in the back corner of a shopping center but so amazingly tasty it's worth the few extra minutes it'll take you to find it.  Great lunch or early dinner spot to quench your BBQ craving!  I had the BBQ Beef Sandwich and my bf had the ribs.  Both of us were incredibly pleased.  Plus, the side dishes are a hearty helping so you can share :)  Very casual setting .... and it's a Steelers joint!  The owner went to school in Pittsburgh so my boyfriend was hooked the second we saw the Steelers flag hanging from the wall ;)",1
"During my trip to Vegas, I made sure I came here. Based off of the reviews and photos from here on Yelp, I was so excited to get my nails done here. Something I don't even do in Seattle!\n\nWhen we first walked in, we were greeted right away by Tina who told us it'd be a few minutes but to sign in. This is something I appreciate! I can't even begin to tell you how many time I've went to a nail shop where I was told to \""""wait 5 minutes\"""" and ended up waiting for a half hour and watching people who came after me get in for their service before me. Right away, my friend was taken back to get her mani/pedi and I was able to set down and get my full set of glitter gel nails.\n\nTina was really nice and made a good amount of conversation during my service. As far as the actual job she did on my nails, I give her a 3.5 rating out of 5. My biggest annoyance and pet peeve when getting my nails done (which isn't often) is making sure my nails are all put on straight and that if I'm getting any sort of coloring, that no spot is missed or is colored on one side more than the other. Tina missed a few areas that aren't noticeable if someone was to look quickly, but I notice the areas which is an annoyance to me and something I wish I was able to look past, but can't!\n\nOther than that, I really liked this place and would probably go back if I was ever in Vegas and wanted cool nails. It is a bit pricey though. I wanted to add jewels and charms, but everything is an additional $5-10 more *per nail* and I already paid $60 for my nails, along with $12 for a tip. Didn't seem worth it to have some jewels put on for $20 when I can go to a drug store and glue some on myself. Tina was also really kind and offered me a drink multiple times. She gave me a coke! Whaaaat? Something other than water and tea? I like it! Haha.\n\nI received multiple compliments on my nails while in Vegas. Glitter nails seem to be popular down there, especially for the cocktail waitresses. But gee, ya don't say?! lol",1

"I LOVE it here. The grocery area of LGO has so many fun, interesting little things to look and buy while you're waiting in the long line to get breakfast. I've bought several cards and little gifts for people here. Though I have come here for breakfast, lunch and dinner, my favorite thing to come here for is breakfast. Be forewarned though, on weekend mornings it is ALWAYS packed. It is going to be LOUD and CROWDED and you are going to have to STAND and WAIT for a while. AKA- don't go here when you're hungover or bring a hungover individual because they will NOT enjoy it (too much hustle and bustle when you're feeling weak/sick). It reminds me of some cafes/groceries I've been to in Europe which I think makes me like it even more. All of the breakfast items are delicious. The commuter sandwich is yummy. I like it with avocado, lox, or turkey, it's good no matter which way you get it because of their amazing English muffins. The day breaker and eggs to order are other faves of mine. I like to snag a picnic table outside and eat out there. Their iced tea is also really good and they serve it with an orange slice instead of a lemon slice.. YUM. They have a great wine section too with lots of different options. And HUGE plus...they are always playing GREAT music....namely Minus the Bear...my favorite band!",1
There were only four people in the restaurant and we waited over 40 minutes for 2 gyro pitas. Slowest service I have ever encountered.  Unacceptable for a order at the counter type of restaurant.  The food was good but not worth the wait.  The staff did not appologize at all for the slow service or explain the delay. They really need to get their act together or this place will be out of business soon.,0

Their Kee Mao is also good.\n\nWhen I'm in the mood, I'll get their spring rolls which aren't too heavy but still filling. Their chicken satay is a good 'healthier' option but not as flavorful or filling as one might like!\n\nAsk for chili garlic sauce on the side if you want an extra kick. The staff is also very friendly and always greets you with a smile on their face.",1
"Shame on this company!\n\nIt is quite disappointing that this is one of the only options from the airport.  Had to deal with typical cab BS. Took one of the longer routes to get me home, thanks for going up the 51 to camelback so that we are now fighting all the lights along that road.  I knew the mileage was a small difference than the route I would have gone, so I begrudgingly kept my mouth shut.  But then, you tell me your credit card machine is conveniently broken, and you'll have to swipe my card manually- No sir, I am no dummy.

I imagine something so nominal most people would not acknowledge, not I! Out of principle I disputed that charge and will stay away from this company in whatever way that I can. I recommend others do the same-",0
"The White Pizza is a must try!! It's one of the restaurant's customer favorites and it tastes amazing. The pizza has chicken, bacon, cheese, arugala, and an amazing garlic parmesan buttery sauce. It wasn't too rich at all and is something I've never tried before. Unfortunately I can't really say the same thing for their Hollywood Cobb salad which was very mediocre and nothing mind blowing. The atmosphere is great and is somewhere you can just sort of hang out. It has a relaxed feel to it and I really like the lighting and simple interior design. For a simple and fun date I recommend this place for the single guys out there. It's a loud and busy place but not to the point where you can't hear each other talking. Also, their red velvet cake is really good. The moist cake and the delectable cream cheese frosting blend together nicely to make a perfectly sweet dessert.",1

"First I should say I was not the customer. My buddy rented a Harley trike for 5 days. He prepaid for the rental thinking he would get a bike similar to the trike shown on the EagleRider website. When we arrived to pick up his ride and thought they were kidding when they showed him the trike. It was a black piece of crap sitting next to a good looking red trike. Again, we thought the rental guys were messing with my friend when they told hime the black one was for him.\n\nThe red one had just come in from a ride and had a clutch problem. I wish I had a close up photo to put on Yelp to show the trike he ended up with. We are all Harley owners and pride ourselves on keeping our bikes looking good and properly serviced. This trike was an embarrassment. The paint was scratched, the fenders were scraped and it looked like it had been cleaned with steel wool. It was a mess to look at. The switch for the  radio volume was missing and the CD player worked intermittently.\n\nThe EagleRider lot guy who checked out the bike said he thought this trike should not be in service but the manager did not really care. The good news was that we had no mechanical problems for our 5 day ride through the canyons of UT, NV and AZ. I would also say that the 2 wheel bikes on the lot looked to be in much better condition.\n\nIf you are renting a trike, make sure you know exactly what you are going to get before you pay for you rental.",0
"This was my first Off-the-Strip Hotel at Las Vegas. I normally have very big reservations staying in these types of joints because I am forced to drive around Vegas which I hate. \n\nResidents know that you NEVER take Las Vegas Blvd if you can't help it and so I have always stayed in Wynn, Belagio, Harrah's, Venetian, etc. But I have to admit The Platinum is AMAZING!\n\nI stayed here on August 17 to 19. The outside was a BLISTERING 114, so I stayed mostly in my hotel room until it was time to go out. One of the reasons I love this hotel so much was that you can fiddle with the AC settings to set the room to 60! \n\nI am a fan of the frost and I abhor heat. Most hotels you can only set the thermostat to say 66 - 64, but this was the first to set it to 60! I know this is a weird reason to love a hotel, but its mine! \n\nI make this claim right now that whenever I go to Vegas over summer, I will ALWAYS stay in The Platinum!\n\nThe rooms were all suite and they are ridiculously spacious; kitchen, living room,, even an open closet for washer and dryer. The kitchen is fully stocked with utensils and a full refrigerator. \n\nThe bedroom was huge and the bathroom had a big tub so my girl can soak in a few minutes.\n\nWhat I don't like was the size of the bed. For a room that big, the bed is a Queen that almost looked like a Full. The pillows were too fluffy to the point they weren't even there. Lastly they seriously need to upgrade their television in the bedroom.. I swear it was those old blocky 1980's CRT televisions.\n\nOverally the rate we paid was around $90. I highly recommend this hotel for the price and quality of room. Now just a word of warning, there is no self-parking it is valet only. The check-in process could be faster as well and there was some sort of mix-up that occurred on my credit card that made them lock me out of my room until I came downstairs to resolve it.\n\nEven with all that shenanigans, I would recommend this.",1
"Went for the Friday fish fry and opted to sit outside which was nice.  Three of us drinks which came lightning fast, then ordered fish and waited and waited and waited.  We also noticed most of the other tables had people looking like they too were wondering where the heck there dinner was.  When our dinners did come out, they were brought by servers, not our waitress.  The food wasn't warm, it was cool.  Fish should be piping hot and it was apparent this had been sitting for a long time to get this cool.  In defense of our waitress, she was working really a lot of tables and I'm not sure if it was her job to deliver the food.   When she asked how our dinner was and we told her it was cold (duh) she asked what she could do.  Well really, what could she do since we sure weren't going to wait another 40 min. for another meal.  She did take off our drinks - two root beers and a beer and while that was appreciated, it didn't make up for the lateness and cold presentation of our food.  There are so many great places to get a hot, tasty Friday fish that I would avoid the Dane.  By the way, the 2 eating next to us said their soup was also cold which they sent back and had to wait 10 min to get it returned to their table hot.  We used to come here frequently and had noticed a decline in the food and service but this time they blew it and I doubt we will be back.",0
"Take it from me folks, I know my candy and I know my candy stores. This one is the BOMB. There's a candy buffet - one price for filling up a bag with bulk candy, and the variety does NOT disappoint. MUCH better than the candy store in the Mirage. So if you went to the candy store in the Mirage, you silly thing, just walk across the street and hit It's Sugar in the Venetian. Not only do they have an amazing assortment of bulk candy for the eating, they've got giant candy bars, assorted candy novelties, and all sorts of interesting things to see. I came back here TWICE while in Vegas. OH, and very important - the candy is fresh. You won't get any stale or wet and clumpy gummi candy here, that's quite important.",1
"The Centennial Hills Anytime Fitness is now EXPRESS FITNESS. If you have a current membership, you have an option to stay with Anytime Fitness or go with the new EXPRESS FITNESS.  I personally encourage everyone to go with EXPRESS. \nWhy? Here are some reasons:\n\n1-This Express Fitness location is almost 12 times larger than the Summerlin Anytime Fitness(the next closest location), and it's about 6-7 times larger than even the larger Anytime locations.\n\n2-The owner(Stuart) is very hands on, and provides excellent customer service. I have never seen a living worker at any of the Anytime Fitness locations in the North West. \n\n3-Anytime Fitness locations have crappy equipment from the 1980s, and the damn access card reader always malfunctions and locks me out of the club.\n\n4-The most important reason to go with EXPRESS FITNESS: There are a ton of smoking hot chicks here. \n\nAs I write this review, I realize that I really gotta get back to the gym. I used to run 6-10 miles every  morning  and then go to the gym to workout for 2 more hours after work. My bodyfat used to hover around 4 to 6 percent. Now I gotta be somewhere in the 10% range and my 6 pack has turned into a piss awful 4-pack.  You yelpers might actually see me here every night for the next couple of months.

"Caught a movie at this theater last night after the most amazing sushi ever.  Too bad the theater didn't really do much to keep the good times rolling.\n\n$21.50 for two tickets.  In Henderson.  Inside a low rent casino.  I don't get that, but movies are expensive, so whatever.  $12.50 for a \""""medium\"""" soda & a \""""medium\"""" popcorn.  I put these sizes in quotes because these are actually what a normal person would consider a large size.  Again, whatever.\n\nWe were 15 minutes early, so I assumed we would be able to score some decent seats.  As previously noted by Rachel S., there really is a giant, waste of space gap in the middle of the theater.  One can only assume this is the hot spot for handicapped folk to catch a flick, otherwise, I don't understand what the hell they are leaving that space seat free for.  Granted, the theater wasn't packed when we got there but almost every seat was taken in the upper deck of the theater, so we sat in a couple end seats and dealt with it.\n\nOne last note: Holy loud speakers.  They showed The Hangover Part II preview - which looked incredible, btw - and it had some rap music in it and my ears were going to blow out.  A little overkill; I'm happy our movie didn't have too much shoot-em-up action.\n\nAnd it wasn't just that the movie we saw, Limitless, was pure crap, either.  Bradley Cooper was hot enough to make it worth my while, but the theater was just OK.",0
"I used to buy everything from Lowes. Salt, filters, water heater, even got a $3500 french back door from them (which they also screwed up btw, but the contractor and myself managed to salvage the project with some artistic trim after a week of fighting with Lowes). Ordered carpet and pad for 3 rooms last month. Paid for their contractor to come out an measure. Went back to Lowes to pay, and asked them if they are sure they got enough carpet for 3 rooms. They said yes. Contractor called to schedule the installation apt, and I asked them if they are sure they have all the carpet they need for the 3 rooms, again yes. Installers show up, and they only have enough for 2 rooms...maybe. I went and took my own measurements, turns out the contractor was over-estimating the room size by 50%, and trying to charge me for it. ie, I had a 9.5' x 13' room. I understand they come in 12' rolls. Even at 12x13 its only 156 sq. ft. They were trying to charge me for 240 sq. ft. Complained to management at Lowes, they didnt want to hear it, and didnt seem to care. Got my money back without much of a fight, and since its their contractors ripping people off, I bumped them a Star. Yes, they are usually helpful, and knowledgeable, but that doesnt excuse ripping people off. Went across the street to HomeDepot, and was assured they dont do this. No problems with them. Im going back to Home Depot for my contractor work.  Buyer beware if you buy anything that isnt on Lowes shelves and requires contract work.",0

Dip it in the tomato soup and it is a bit of heaven (or your childhood...).  When I feel like switching it up, I'll usually get the chinese chicken salad.  The chicken is shredded and the dressing (ginger-soy) is so delish....I usually end up ordering an extra side of the dressing because I like it so much.\n\nIf you are in the Kierland/Scottsdale Q area for lunch, do not hesitate one bit to come into Chloe's Corner for lunch.

I get several a year mailed to me and there are always coupons available to print on line. Too bad.  No discount without a printed coupon.  So I drive home and get the coupon.  The coupon price is $16 - 24 depending on location.  Of course this location charges $24.  There is also a $10 fee for registering with them instead of at DMV.

Nice and clean. You can always find something at Target. The staff is very helfpul and friendly. I think during my trip I had three associates ask me if I needed any help. The cafe up front has a PizzaHut express as well as pretzels and Icees.,1

"Kind of under impressed. We've been here about a year ago and enjoyed it much more. We went for lunch. Beautiful setting and the service was good but slow. However we weren't in a hurry so it didn't matter.  My husband ordered the pulled pork gumbo with an egg and corn muffin. The presentation was beautiful and he thought it tastes great. I ordered the escarole salad with maple dressing, pomegranate seeds, candied pecans and goat cheese. Unfortunately the dressing made the lettuce look brown like old lettuce. Presentation boring. A couple of tiny pecan pieces and a few very small crumbles of goat cheese. Chicken or a LOT more cheese would have been a nice addition. This came with no bread so we ordered a \""""bread coarse\"""". The toasted bread was black on some pieces and the non-toasted bread was rather dry. For dessert we shared a brownie with cranberry ancho sauce. Presentation was nice. It came with a \""""scoop\"""" of vanilla bean gelato that was tablespoon size.

Usually regular polish chips within a couple days! It is true that some Steelers go here. One time I sat right next to one in a pedicure chair. I also recommend Nancy because she is very personable and so sweet. She even has a great memory! I moved to NYC for a year and came back to Nails USA for the first time since I moved back to Pittsburgh and she remembered me...and my mom! They're a little more pricey than most places, but it's worth it. You'll have long lasting nails and a great experience if you go to Nails USA!!",1
"On our way to Mexico we decided to eat because we knew it would be hours before we could get a chance again.  We picked this place because it was a sports bar and it had a good menu selection.  All Sports TV, Drinks, and Food in one place....can't miss, right?\n\nI ordered Nachos and received a plate of the saltiest chips ever and the thinnest layer of scorched cheese.  So I have to assume the cheese was put on the chips and then micro-waved.  You know you have done this one at home.  Instead of microwaving for 45 seconds to melt the cheese you set the timer for four minutes longer than necessary.  Blech!  The other toppings barely sprinkled only the topmost layer of chips.  Not that it mattered as I had to push this dish away fairly untouched.  I could feel my feet instantly swelling from the sodium content.\n\nThis place gets a two star rating for the abundance of TV's and the Apple Wood Bacon they serve on their burgers.  Eat somewhere else and come here for the drinks and sports.",0

I have no doubt in my mind this guy was going to try and pocket the cash.\n\nAvoid this place like the plague.",0
"Nice design and atmosphere.  Very mediocre service.  Extensive menu that gets your hopes up, but I've never really had anything very good there.

Always mixing up my order and they aren't friendly about fixing it either. I actually drive farther to avoid this Starbucks even though it's on my way to the freeway. It used to be good but I think the good employees moved on. The Starbucks north of the 215 on Rainbow is way better.,0

"So my hair stylist moved to Hawaii and I desperately needed a hair cut. After reading the reviews I decided to give Hotbox a try. I called up and they were able to get me in same day, score. The lady on the phone wasn't overly friendly, but asked my price range which I definitely appreciated. I walked in about 10 minutes early and my stylist was waiting for me and took me in immediately. The place is very open and has a fun vibe and some disco music playing. She asked me what I wanted to do and I told her that I wanted to go shoulder length with maybe a little angling around my face. She was a little apprehensive at first because I was cutting 8 inches off, but I do this about every other year so I told her to go for it. She said she would add some layers too and it seemed like we were on the same page. So she shampooed and conditioned my hair and started cutting. She was friendly, but didn't make a ton of small talk so for the most part it was pretty quiet. She said that she would start with it a bit long and then cut it shorter if I wanted and I definitely appreciated the apprehensiveness to just hack it all off. Well, she ended up starting it off pretty short and just kept cutting from there. After she was done cutting, I asked her to straighten it for me. As she was blowdrying it she was making curls and said it would look really pretty that way, so I let her do it that way. When it was finished I hated it and it looked a little longer on one side, so I hoped it was just the curls and asked her to straighten it so I could really see the cut. Well she straightened it and I just wasn't sure, so I left. When I got home it was evident that it was longer on one side, by almost and inch, and the angling around my face was much longer on one side, in fact one side hit me under my chin and the other side hit me just above my jaw line...seriously!! I am pretty low maintenance when it comes to my hair, in fact I rarely get it cut more than twice a year and I am generally happy with whatever cut I get. In this case I am furious and devastated. I have a cut that is lopsided and the only way to fix it is to cut more hair, but I feel like I barely have any hair left! There are very few hairs on my head that are shoulder length, the majority are these tiny little layers. I look so masculine, almost like Peter Pan. It is definitely not cute and considering I have naturally curly hair it is almost worse curly! I seriously have never had a bad hair cut, this is my first time and I can't wait for it to grow out. I would not recommend this salon to anyone!",0
"I would have given Ulta 5 stars if there were no employees. I shall elaborate:\n\nThey carry damn near everything beauty-related. Makeup, both drugstore and high end? Got it. Hair care? Got it. Beauty tools? Yep. Fragrance? You bet. I've often found myself wanting to try a particular product from a large brand, only to find that Target, Walmart, etc, don't carry it. 9 Nine times out of 10, Ulta has the product. While it is a beauty store, it is not a beauty supply store. If you need a color mixing bowl or latex gloves, a large selection of extensions or waxing supplies, take yourself to Sally's. But, if you need product, Ulta's the place!\n\nThat being said, the customer service is just awful. If you go in just wanting to browse for nothing in particular, you'll be pounced upon by some lady who tells you, in effect, that you look like crap and she can help you do so much better. Not my favorite sales tactic, especially when they expect you to purchase a product in return for their advice and whatever line they're shilling is just out of your budget. Now, say you go in looking for a particular big brand product that Target doesn't carry. You will not be able to find an employee that can locate it in the store or tell you if they have it. If you're browsing in the areas where products are under $30 a piece, no one can help you. Don't expect help if you're not part of the \""""luxury market\"""".\n\nMy advice: search their website for the item you want, read the reviews, memorize the packaging, then go to the store with enough knowledge that you don't need help.",1

"Truly one of the great collegiate spots for Mex-American cuisine! \n\nI love chipotle. I loved it more after watching their documentary on Netflix.

Love that they have brown rice options too now. \n\nI think this is a great location because you can call ahead and pick up your order, if you're in a rush. It's true, this place usually gets high influx around normal eating times (12p, 5p) with all the array of interesting bodies Maryland Pkwy has to offer.

I am unimpressed. This is not a welcoming coffee house. There is nothing cozy here.\n\nI am on a constant hunt for good chai. I didn't find it here. I know the company Cartel orders their mixes from makes a spicier chai. Based on other reviews it's either not ordered anymore or was ordered by accident before. The chai was pretty much all latte and hardly any chai.\n\nThey will pretty much assume any drink you order is to go. Not surprising because who would want to sit around on the ridiculously uncomfortable chair things? They are literally concrete blocks with bent metal for a back and a thin pad for the seat. Steal a pad or two from other chairs and don't try to lean back. Ouch ouch ouch.,0
"Go. Now. Their passion is in the product. I have never in my life encountered such great coffee--even on my trip to San Fran. They are one of the first places in Charlotte to offer almond milk as an alternative to soy or dairy--neither of which I can tolerate well. I got my first latte and didn't have much in the way of expectations but I was sweetly surprised when I took my first sip-- from that point I became a (passionate) regular. James is very friendly and patiently answered all my questions about how and why he opened Not Just Coffee and how the hell he and his staff get it to taste so good. He gave a lot of credit to the peeps at Counter Culture Coffee (the coffee that NJC uses) and their willingness to help him make the coffee all that it was meant to be. My only regret was that I didn't get to spend enough time soaking up his coffee-know-how due to an abrupt move to Houston, Texas and so now I have no clue how to create coffee like him and his crew and sadly I have yet to find anything that compares to Not Just Coffee in Houston.

"Cool spot to hangout after a round of golf.  It's located at the Phoenician Resort at the golf clubhouse area.  Some friends and I popped in after a round for a bite to eat and some drinks.  It was raining that day, so we camped out next to the fireplace to dry off.  We were soaking wet from playing golf all day in the rain and since it was the end of Summer, the AC was cranked on full tilt here.\n\nTo warm ourselves up we ordered a shot of premium Patron Tequila and I had a glass of Woodford Reserve Bourbon, neat.  The Tequila went down smooth and warmed me up real fast.  I savored the Bourbon and sipped it slowly while enjoying the conversation about our day of golf and other random things.\n\nFor food, we decided to order some Onion Rings ($8), Garlic Fries ($7), and Chips & Salsa w/Guacamole ($14).  We shared the appetizers.  They were very good and a perfect snack to enjoy while we hung out.\n\nOur waitress was very attentive and made sure our glasses weren't empty.  One of the guys in our group volunteered to pick up the tab because he lost a bet on the golf course....which was good because the shot of premium Patron was $45....wait, what?!\n\nOverall, it was a good time.  Next time I try the Burgers on the menu.\n\nReturn Factor - 87%",1
"Century link is the worst Internet, phone services I've ever received. It's been 16 days and my service I paid for up front is still not TURNED ON! When I call to try and solve the problems all they do is give me the run around. Today alone I talked to 11 different Century link employees in 6 different departments. Now there telling me they can't fix it for 7 days \""""there just to busy\"""". Wow to busy, that's great. I can't believe this is the way they handle customers. Cox may be more expensive but I'm taking my business to them, a cheaper bill is not worth this headache, oh and I forgot to mention that it's going to take 6-8 weeks for them to refund my money I paid up front.",0
"Sooo Good, our family loves this place, super kid friendly too.  The dumplings are so good.",1
"Over-priced, over-crowded and every time I have been there...it has confirmed that they pour the worst martini!\nBut if you are looking to 'people watch' this is the place - the interior permits a great open ambiance  with an open area overlooking the bar. I think the exhaust-system isnt strong enough for the Teppan tables because I smell like heavy fried food when I leave!!",0
"Cheap, good, and they give a great amount of shrimp!",1
I ordered my meal very clearly to the cashier but they got it wrong. I didn't like the food it was dry. I won't be eating there again. The floors were dirty too.,0
"We came here after hitting the Monarch Theater right next door. It was 10 bucks per person to get in. For a bar that has a club type of vibe, they actually had a good beer to drink. Odell IPA. I mean, every other dance club type of establishment the have only the normal Bud/Miller/Coors. \n\nI give this place 3 stars because downstairs sucks. The DJ down there sucked really bad, and the smoke machine smelled like crap. Downstairs is a hip hop type of vibe, and upstairs had EDM house music being mixed. As a big time EDM fan, I heard some Wolfgang Gartner, Feed Me, and Porter Robinson. Good stuff. Great music going on upstairs. \n\nUpstairs was awesome, but just way too cramped. Another thing that sucked was that there was a crap ton of dudes dancing up there. They should have taken a queue from the Monarch next door and let ladies in for free.  They ought to have the EDM DJ downstairs, and put the hip hop DJ out of a job, because no one was dancing to his mix. I mean, I tried to give him a chance, but he was playing THE WORST hip hop.Stuff you have never heard that is not dance worthy. I am not expecting the Scottsdale hip hop mash up, but it would hurt to play something someone has actually heard. \n\nPrices were average. 5 bucks for an Odells and 7 bucks for a liquor mixer. I would come back here if they did something better with the downstairs. The bar counters downstairs were really sticky, and there was barely anyone down there. Would it hurt to wipe down your counters more frequently? \n\nI down rated it to 2 stars because of the split atmosphere, and the overwhelming amount of dudes. Otherwise, if it wasn't a sausage fest, I would have given it 3, and if the downstairs wasn't lame, it would get a 4.",0
"I was looking for a new vet and got really lucky when I found Dr. K.  He explains everything,  doesn't do anything without telling you the cost first and is absolutely the best vet I have ever met.  I have an aggressive golden who never had a good vet visit.  It was horrible watching her freak out and not letting any dr. near her.  We had to cover her head with a blanket just to get her vaccinated.  Anyway, Dr. K understands what makes dog tick and he knew how to approach her.  He actually took blood from her!  All I can say is if you need a new vet, call Dr. k.  rose p.",1
"Who charges extra to get a drink with easy ice??? This is not right. And they don't even tell you until the bill comes. The food was good. Got the pad Thai, green curry, and Tom kha soup. Everything was pretty sweet. Just a heads up seems like they put sugar in everything.",0
"I'm so disgusted that I plan on going there tomorrow to speak with a REAL manager. Bartender lied about being the management. Very unprofessional.  I intend on calling management tomorrow about my experience. It was inconsistent and unprofessional. I do not recommend this location. The only good this about this place is the dj and host. Announcing drink specials when not available is unacceptable. I will not come here for a reg spot, only for birthdays. Rude, short dark hair bartender. For the tip we left plus the 13 people in attendance to my friends birthday party should have been better attended to. Horrible service even though there were MULTIPLE employees in attendance. Bad birthday. Never again. Ever...",0
"Hands down, the best all you can eat sushi I have ever had. All the fish, from the salmon to the sea urchin, was extremely fresh and delicious. Moreover, the attentive sushi chefs and wait staff took great care in seeing that I was happy.",1
"The Griddle Cafe is one of my favorite Cali spots.  I go almost every trip.  I was so excited that they were coming to Vegas.  We waited a few weeks for the crowds to die down.  Well they died down alright.  The first time we went...they were closed.  We asked security nearby and they said they shortened their hours to 11-4 during the week and 24 hrs only on the weekend.  He said they were slow at night.  I was expecting a line.  That didn't seem like a good sign.  Less then a month and already cutting back on hours.  Is the SLS that dead?  Damn.  Turns out it is 11pm-4pm.  So not near as bad as 11am-4pm we took it as.  I thought I was never going to get to eat here.  Finally we venture back, I got Red Velvet PanCAKE and hubby got a Shrimp BLT.  Same quality, taste and huge portions as their LA counterpart.  Our food was great but service could have been better.  Waiter wasn't the best and then kept the change without asking.  That was kinda weird to just assume I'm gonna give you a 34% tip on your shitty service.  I am a fan of Griddle Cafe and food was just as good as in LA so I will be back and hopefully the service was a fluke this time.",1
"Great happy hour every day from 5-7pm. Half off prime bites like steak burger sliders, lobster sliders, lobster bacon fondue, crab cakes, meatball sliders, flatbread and shrimp. Half off wines by the glass and spirits.\n\nIn the Caesars Forum Shops right outside the Casino. I really enjoyed the happy hour. Although it's a chain restaurant the food is excellent and the wine list is awesome! Go to happy hour for good food and wine at a great price! Restaurants in Vegas can be pricy - the Palm usually offers great monthly specials if you join the email club. \n\nSee you back at happy hour next year when I am in Vegas!",1
"I think the location is awesome BUT the room not so much. Maybe because I should have been on a higher floor, I was on 10. My room needed an upgrade. The beds were saggy (dbl rm) in the middle, the shower is too small and kinda black in corners, I believe it may have been mold or dirt?? Bad reception on my cell and my 3G ipad. Internet cost 15 a day. The best thing I had in the room service, was room service. I was here for work, if I had had a choice, I'd of certainly stayed elsewhere.",0
"To have lived a life knowing that nothing was left on the table.  That's what I imagine deathbed-Eric saying as he looks back on a fulfilled life.  Well, all that went to hell after I ate at this just awful place.  \n\nA couple buddies and I decided to come her before heading out on the town.  Considering we generally subscribe to the dives and hole in the walls with good food mindset when it comes to food, we thought a restaurant by the host of a similarly named show would work splendidly.  We were so wrong.  I think about those hole in the walls that have created a name for themselves based off of a passion for quality of food.  When I think of the exact opposite, Guy Fieri's comes to mind.  The food was largely bland and unimaginative.  For as much as he has seemingly experienced, I was expecting a lot more.  I can only imagine that they provide so much food so that the sure to follow food coma dismisses all potential of motivation for negative thoughts.\n\nFood aside, I do have to give a lot of credit to the staff.  My friend's water glass broke mid-drink.  Literally.  The bottom fell from the glass while he was drinking, and, well you can imagine what happened from that.  Sheer pandemonium of course.  Women were screaming.  Kids were crying.  Cars were burning.  It was mass chaos.  No not really...it was just inconvenient.  The manager, whom I did not notice prior, was on it in a heartbeat.  He was over to our table in what seemed like a matter of seconds apologizing.  On top of that, he even managed to comp a meal, a couple beers, and give a free desert for the table.  That attentiveness was impressive.\n\nThough the service was excellent, there isn't much that would bring me back here.",0
"Inattentive waitress keeps forgetting us both food and drink -- wanders off and must be flagged down. Food is greasy and flavorless, even the burger bun. Disgusting.",0
"Came here with five other people. We all enjoyed but were not blown away with the restaurant, so I gave it four stars.\n\nFirstly, the view is beautiful. Maybe come here on one of your first nights in Las Vegas, especially if you are not staying in or near the Bellagio/Paris (we stayed in the Paris hotel). If you are always around the fountains, they do get old after awhile. But then again, it's a different, more grand vantage point to enjoy them from.\n\nWe didn't take advantage but if you have an early 5:00 pm dinner, they will seat you at a window immediately. This is probably because Las Vegas diners come out pretty late for dinner and dining rooms are pretty empty until 7 p.m. hits.\n\nThe service is not particularly friendly, but I'm never really impressed by overly enthusiastic waiters anyway, so that was fine by me. One exception was the server who came around with bread. He was so enthusiastic about his bread. Lol. Great guy. \n\nMy husband and I both had the filet mignon with truffle sauce. It arrived...warmish, not hot. We had to remind the server we also had the truffle sauce, which came in a separate sauce boat. It arrived after the reminder. And we also didn't get proper steak knifes, which took away from the experience a little bit. \n\nThe other people at the table liked their dishes, the bread, etc. My father in law ordered the veal medallions but a big hunk of lamb chop was placed in front of him. He alerted the server to the error but the server tried to pass off the lamb chop as \""""better\"""" and acted surprised when my FIl still insisted on the veal medallions. That was odd. He later apologized for the mistake but it was still an odd way to handle the situation.\n\nWe ordered dessert souffles (caramel for hubby and I, strawberry for the other two couples) and it was a truly exceptional souffl\u00e9 which made up for the other mistakes at the meal. I would highly recommend!\n\nThe mistakes not withstanding, the restaurant is great for a romantic dinner. It could use a little more polish considering the pricing, but the ambiance makes up for all of that.",1
"Let me preface this fact: I have eaten what could amount to a family of cows (that would be daddy cow, momma cow and 2.5 child cows) in carne asada during my life. Needless to say I like it. This doesn't make me an MD in C.A. but I've had really good (i.e. Yeah, I loved it so much I'd marry it.) and really bad (i.e. Truly thought I'd die.) and everything in between.\n\nThat said I'd place America's Taco shop squarely in the middle. Again, it's just my opinion but it was really nothing special. Maybe, and I say MAYBE, I was slightly thrown by the hype and was expecting too much.\n\nThat alone though wouldn't have merited my two stars. I eat at plenty of places with just-okay quality of food but I go back because of the atmosphere or service. But the fact that the wait was over 30 minutes for two tacos, a vampiro and a burrito was part of it.\n\nAlso, the help was less than, um, help. Two teenagers with that wonderful teen-approach to service. Example, not knowing exactly what an item includes. Lastly, the prices. A vampiro at most places is the size of a good portioned tostada. At A.T.S. however everything down to the burrito was half the size of what I expected, and pricier. I understand the tacos being small as is traditional for carne asada tacos but don't price them $3 a pop. I could get the same quality and half the price at Food City (no joke).\n\nThe seating was really limited so this place would probably be best for a pick-up order to avoid the wait.\n\nThe positives were that that the food came exactly as I'd ordered it and also they served elote (corn) traditional style which you don't see much outside of late night taco stands. Also, the place was clean and the small house it was built into was neat.",0
"My favorite place to see movies here in Phoenix. I love independent films and this is the best place to see them at! Recently see The King`s Speech, The Fighter and Black Swan all here. Its a smaller theater, more intimate but I like that. Place does fill up quickly even during the week in the evenings. And on a holiday, always packed!! Spent my last Christmas here, but worth it!! \nSo if you like indie, foreign and the limited release films, then come here! Or if you are a film fan altogether, you won`t be disappointed!! Right near Fashion Square, so there are many amenities to choose for dining options before or after a movie.",1
"Smell terrible from the minute you walk in. Facilities are clean, but the food is terrible. Chicken, beef, and pork dishes are not hot. Plus the food has bland taste. \nEgg rolls were cold and are lacking ingredients. I am not very picky when it comes to the restaurants I eat at; there is something I can generally find good to eat. But this was the worst food I have ever ate. I would save your money and eat at any other establishment in that area.",0
"If I need wings, I head to Wing King.  I live a block from a Wild Wing and I STILL drive miles to go to Wing King.  It's a little gritty on the inside, but that only guarantees great fried meat.  The service is friendly and fast, but the parking can be a pain since you're fighting a dozen other shops in this gas station/strip mall.  My favorite wing flavor is the salt and pepper.  Huge chunks of ground black pepper and tasty salt crystals flavor the wings perfectly.  Their house salad is huge.  It is a great item to split.  Top everything off with some of the best ranch dressing around.  I have never been disappointed in the King.",1

"I went to this uhaul to have a trailer hitch installed.  I paid on line and when I went into the shop the cashier lowered the paid price by using a kit instead of individual pieces.

The service was completed before the estimated amount of time.  Everyone s polite and professional.  Thanks u-haul!",1
IF YOU WANNA SPEND 1-2 HOURS WAITING IN LINE THEN COME HERE! Worst rental place I've been to! They only had 1 gentleman working and I know it's not his fault but with the constant shuttle brining more and more tourist to the car rental his bosses should've hired more people or something.. I'm not usually the type of person to bash any businesses but they was UNSAT! I'm not even a tourist so I can only imagine getting off a plane after sitting for 6 plus hours to only stand for another 1 or so... \n\nIf only I can give a negative star!!,0
"I had a very interesting experience at this location!  The girl behind the counter had a sense of humor, but it was a touch on the... ghetto side.  When I got done ordering my food she looks at me and simply says \""""No, you can't have that\"""".  Ok, funny, ha ha.  Give me my f#$%ing sandwich.  \n\nI ordered the Buffalo Wrap.  Now, I admit, I am not formally trained in sandwich manufacturing, but this item did not sound like rocket science.  Apparently I was wrong.  17 minutes later, and a really entertaining bickering session back and forth by the staff, my masterpiece arrives.  The wrap had a decent flavor - a bit heavy on the Buffalo sauce, but whatever.  They are getting 2 stars only because the wrap was good.  Not for service, not for humor.  \n\nBest part is there was an older gentleman that ordered behind me that did not appreciate the \""""you can't have a sandwich\"""" comedy skit and got into a bit of an arguement with the employee... to which she actually tried to defend herself.\n\nSorry, you get one shot - I won't be back.",0
So I guess now I have to start the legal process to get this company to fix the house I'm renting it's been over a month and problems just keep popping up! I warn you now don't work with these people no matter how nice the house is!,0
It is now 6 times I have come here and everyone has been a 5 star and same for my guests I have brought....They know me well enough now. I even feel at easy to speak to them in chinese with the little I know. \n\nGreat work keep it up.,1
"NOT A FAN.  I only refrained from giving one-star because the Ahi Tuna is probably one of the prettiest dishes I've seen (take a look at my pic NOW haha)\n\nLuckily I didn't go in super high expectations, but I can't imagine this standing up to many of the other restaurants within 20 feet walking distance.  We ordered the Crusted Ahi Tuna and the Pecan Crusted Redfish.  Appearance was awesome!  The Ahi Tuna's taste was alright, and I just didn't enjoy the Redfish.  I understand that tastes/types of food differ and this many not have been the spot for me, but my complaints come from the service.\n\nProblem number one is that we had two waiters through the night, which is already confusing.  Maybe they got their game plan confused:  They each asked us \""""how we were doing\"""" once during dinner.  They asked within a minute of each other, immediately after we received food and before we started eating.  Awesome.\n\nProblem number two is possibly related to how young I look (or maybe I'm looking into it too much).  The waiter dropped off the menu when he seated us.  After our meal he didn't ask if we wanted dessert and dropped off our check.  Now, this normally wouldn't bother me too much.  I started getting pissed when our same waiter (the one that gave us our menu) seated an older couple right next to us.  He proceeded to give a detailed explanation of their specialty dishes, recommendations, as well as explaining the option of a pricey prix-fixe tasting menu.  I'm not saying I would have ordered differently if I did get the speel, but still....give it regardless!  Also, I was peeking around at all the desserts passing by -drool-...but not like we had the opportunity to order anyways.\n\nI felt pretty neglected (we all just need some love right?) especially for a restaurant that wasn't even half-full.  It's one of the only instances that I've walked out and complained directly to the host.  He seemed very sincere which was nice...but didn't offer for us to give them another chance, if you know what i mean ;)",0
"This was AWESOME! The staff treated me like a lifelong customer even though it was only my 2nd visit. I'm from our if state but they definitely made me feel at home. The staff really knew their stuff and gave me some great recommendations. The atmosphere was great, no matter the age group. It also didn't matter how much of a fan/nerd/fanboy you are or if you're just a casual fan or shopping for a gift. Big thanks to the owners who ate really cool but also/especially Jaime who remembered me & was super nice/cool/hilarious. The only negative was the new comics section but that was due to some sort of anomaly due to the holidays. I can't comment on the coffee; I didn't order one.\n\n I know that seems like I'm going overboard, but I've worked in comics before and thus I can appreciate how well run this place is. Strongest recommendation to check this place out!",1
"Top shelf all the way, from the cigars, to the liquor to the service.  The humidor is kept at a perfect 70/70 and the selection is great, most major labels, and some hard to find sticks as well.  The bar is also stocked to the hilt with a good beer selection as well as top shelf rye, scotch, bourbon etc.  \n\nI thought the service was excellent from the time I walked into the humidor to the time I paid the bill, the staff was attentive without being invasive. \n\nIf I have any criticism it was the ventilation (I've seen better) and the price, but in this case you get what you pay for.",1
"Simply horrible customer service at the store. Note to Cox, train your idiot of an employee Chris at the new Marks St store to be quiet and listen to the customer before running his mouth about something he obviously has no clue about. SMH. Customers would have more spec for someone that says I don't know than pull answer out of his ass without looking into the situation simply because he's trying to funnel through customers. Extreme disappointed with Cox thanks to your incompetent employee Chris.",0
"Awesome family breakfast place. Really friendly atmosphere, and interesting menu. My wife had the Garden of Eden omelet, which she strongly endorses, and i had pretty much the opposite: the Home Run french toast. If you love sweet stuff, this is the french toast for you. It's basically a PB&J made on graham crackers, fried in Reese flavored butter and topped with banana and powdered sugar. Might not be for everyone (my wife could only have one bite), but I loved it. It was hard to choose, everything on the menu looked great and the service was so friendly. Top marks.",1
"Seriously my favorite part of my Vegas trip was EBC!\n\nOk I should probably say that this review is probably skewed a bit because of our awesome promoter that we randomly meant on the strip, Richie Palou. He hooked us up with no cover, minimal line, and access to a stretch of several cabanas/day beds to hang at. There was also free mimosas for ladies until 2. In addition, he wouldn't even take my measly 10 dollar tip and just said to enjoy ourselves (but not to say that you shouldn't try)! Such a sweet guy. So with that said, I didn't pay a cover or for drinks so my experience was probably different than for others (especially guys!)\n\nWe went on a Sunday (which I was told was the best day to go). And guess who was the DJ...none other than Lil Jon! He was really good too. The place itself has a fun ambience with a lot of palm trees and the cabanas are adorable with red curtains and day beds. The cabanas had balconies that opened up to the street. They also were stalked with towels and glasses. Coat check is only 10 per bag so we just put all of our smaller bags into one big bag and split the cost making it really cheap. The water wasn't murky like others have complained. I would recommend getting there by 12 (1 at the latest). Try to get the hookups if you can but if not I'd definitely recommend this. I enjoyed it much more than a night club- no heels while dancing and get a tan at the same time! :]",1
"If the US Post Office goes away, it will be because the service is nonexistent. Friendly enough people, just slow. Understaffed and slow as (choose your own analogy). No sense of urgency or services like you might find at FedEx or UPS. Came here on a Saturday for a passport renewal. Arrived at 11:00 AM. Still waiting at 12:30. Upon arrival there were several other passport customers ahead of us. The crazy part, they did not have someone working passports the whole time. They seemed to be trying to juggle the mailing & shipping responsibilities with the passport services. Sure it's an hour and a half, but it \""""feels\"""" longer every time no one works the passport services and more passport customers arrive. My recommendation to you the reader of this review; fly into San Francisco and go to the proper Passport Services. You might save some energy.",0
"Good food, if you can get attention. One guy that works there pays no attention to the register and after 10 min waiting, LOOKING at him just staring at the computer behind the bar, made me decide I'll wait and maybe next time I go for a haircut they will be paying attention... :(",0
"I purchased a living social deal for the super shot program and feel I got the old \n\""""bait-and-switch\"""".  It is a form of fraud used in retail sales but also practiced in other contexts. First, customers are baited by merchants' advertising products or services at a low price, but when customers visit the store and the customers are pressured by sales people to consider similar, but higher priced items (switching). What was offered was ridiculously expensive for the product you would receive (a powdered breakfast, lunch and snack for three months) for more than $1,200.00.  I will now always search reviews before purchasing anything like this on line again.",0
"Only 4 stars because there was lots of stuff broke in the rooms (for a triple diamond hotel and the price paid they need to get that fixed).  I say \""""rooms\"""" too because several people staying told me the same thing.  Overall amazing experience though.  Great staff, great conference area, great food and desserts.  I really enjoyed the grounds too - it is hard to find a more amazing view.  just flat out enjoyed my time here for the SMX Social Media conference.",1
"I had such a great time at this place both times i went.  The first visit was a sushi dinner extravaganza with my sister.  The place was literally a 10 minute walk from my childhood home, where my parents still live, which was the first bonus for this place.  Once i walked in my excitement grew.  The place was small and intimate although a bit on the hot side.  Our waitress spoke with a heavy japanese accent and she was very friendly.  \n\nWe ordered a bunch of rolls, they have a fairly small selection of rolls which is fine with me, and some nigiri.  They even had Uni!  i dont know how it is in phoenix but i live in Salt Lake City and Uni is incredibly hard to find there for some unknown reason.  Anyways the sushi was well prepared and tasted very fresh.  Their yellowfin was just amazing!\n\nMy next visit was a lunch with my mother a few days later and we ate mostly non-sushi offerings which were also very good.  I had yakisoba which was delicious and my mother had the bento box with teriyaki steak which was also fantastic.  \n\nThis place is a real gem and for me personally the location is perfect.",1

"Great Gym - Horrible Contract and Corporate Communciation. They do not update their website or phone aps (though they like to advertise them) to fit their current gym schedules. They do not care why you need to cancel; only that you are not moving. And if you are moving, you better be prepared to produce 2 supporting documents (lease, which we all know takes time to get; bank, which in this day in age you don't have to change when you move, or utility bill, which requires that lease). \n\nFor those who will be long-term Vegas/Henderson residents, maybe you'd want to work out here (though I would read the other one star reviews below) but for people like myself who are here on contract and was originally looking for a \""""local\"""" gym so I could support local business - I wish I had never signed with them.

Had a great massage at a great intro price.  also had an overview tour of facility and the services offered.  Very impressive.  I will go back.,1
Goodness at your fingertips. Flavorful breading and awesome sauce will get me working out at the gym much more to keep the cholestrol down and continue to indulge in this fried goodness.\n\nThe sauce brings it all together. Its an aioli (fancy mayonaise) with a chili pepper kick to it.\n\nOrder extra sauces so you don't run out near the end due to dipping the fries and the buttery toasted bread in along with the chicken strips! Chicken strips! Just saying it makes me smile. Chicken Strips!,1

"I gotta admit...I had mediocre expectations for Italian Pie...but they were completely put to rest after last night's meal! Hooray for good 'za. \n\nGive me a thin, crispy, garlic dusted crust and a tasty pie and I'm hooked. We met some friends here early on a Monday evening and not only had some great food, but really solid and friendly service too. The beer and wine list is decent - although I be they could add a few more local beers on tap in time. The interior hasn't changed too much since Sole - similar layout, yet cozy. Here are a few things I snacked on last night with a table of friends...\n\nFried cheese sticks: 2/5: A bit unremarkable overall. The cheese was *fine* and marinara dipping sauce had a nice flavor to it but it was very thin. And two out the six cheese sticks were without cheese. Yep, just fried fakers. \n\nGarlic cheese bread: 5/5: Um, hello lover. This little app came out as a tiny cheese pizza pie drizzled with (what I assume to be) garlic oil. It was hot and cheesy and garlicky and damn delicious. \n\nMargherita pizza: 4.5/5: Our server recommended this pie and I ordered it with trepidation...I say it that way because margherita pies tend to be pretty bland. But oh no, not this pie. It was packed full of flavor - plenty of pepper, garlic, two types of cheese, fresh tomato and that really perfect crust. My only tiny ish? It was fairly greasy underneath - but no worries, I'll blot that right off. Go go flavor explosion. \n\nGet ye some pizza and try out Italian Pie...delizioso!",1
"Horrible food, horrible service! We paid for our salads and drinks and left it was so bad. The server told us, after being seated for just under an hour, that they were out of manicotti. On a Saturday night at 7:00 pm, this place was out of manicotti. That was the last straw. This was after I had picked olive oil & garlic instead of pesto for my tortellini because they were out of that too. I was charged almost six dollars a piece for the pathetic excuses for salads and told, \""""but I didn't charge you for the garlic bread.\"""" We had sent that back after it showed up extremely over done and having a horrible taste. So I guess I was supposed to be grateful for not having to pay for that! Our server was a space cadet and my iced tea didn't get refilled until I said something after waiting 30 mins. for the server to notice. I don't normally write scathing reviews, but this place is worthy. I paid sixteen dollars for the worst dining experience of my life and left hungry!",0
Bugs!!!! Once I saw it I was quiet to not scare the other customers. Later I asked to refill my drink and she gave me an attitude.  I could have made a scene but didn't. And they didn't give discount on the food. Never again will I come back.,0
"I am just waiting for the day this bar closes down because it really needs to.   Lets just say that absolutely nothing about the Atomic Koi is a positive in my mind including their rude and terrible bartenders, the crappy 80's movies they have on the TV's, the atmosphere that is as ugly as the blue Christmas lights on the patio, and the lack of people.\n\nI was told not to write this review since we live in the area but sorry....I am not going there anymore so I am going to have at it.  Last night we went to Atomic Koi for some drinks as we have many times before.  The 4 of us were literally the only people there.  The bartender, who was new since I have never seen him there before, was a asshole specifically to me.   I wish I could say that this was an isolated incident but each time I have been there the bartenders are pricks.\n\nSo, Atomic Koi and your overpriced drinks....so long because my business is gone.  Please somebody buy this place and turn it into a Sports Bar or something worth going to.   Obviously the rest of Fitchburg feels the same way since I never see anyone there.",0
"Well to be completely honest, a rocker/biker bar isn't really a place I would seek out under normal circumstances.  \n\nBut these weren't normal circumstances.\n\nLong story short, we were throwing my husband a birthday party at KISS Mini-Golf and while talking about it one night we looked out of curiosity for KISS tribute bands in the area.  Well, since you're dying to know- yes, there is a KISS tribute band and they were just-so-happening to be playing at Vamp'd the day after my husband's birthday party.\n\nThe day of the show we were still up in the air about if we were going to go.  Besides the fact that it's a bit of a drive for us, we were worried that us two nerds would look incredibly out of place in a rocker bar.  But at 10 p.m. I looked at my husband and exclaimed \""""Life! Embrace it!,\"""" changed into the most rockin' shirt I could find, took two shots of vodka, and hopped in the car.  \n\nVamp'd has a dark, rock-themed interior with a bar area when you first come in.  Past the bar is a decent-sized stage with plenty of standing room or tables that you can reserve ahead of time.  Drinks are average in price ($5 for a well drink, $4 for a beer).  The bathrooms are clean and even have an attendant!  Bonus points for Vamp'd!\n\nAmongst the customers you can find: long-haired rockers, metal dudes, rockabilly chicks, some drunk folks reliving their 80's heyday, and even an emo boy if you look hard enough... So, yeah, we did get a few looks at first when we came in.  But this ended up being the friendliest crowd I've ever had the pleasure of hanging out with!  The security guards, the people standing next to me waiting for the show to start, the random drunk lady in the bathroom that told me I looked like Pocahontas....they were all friendly and chatty unlike the crowds at pretty much every other bar I've been to.\n\nOh, and did I mention there was a VIP section with some older dudes that looked like Rod Stewart, Vince Neil, and Bret Michaels all decked out in their leather and jewelry hanging out with some cute little grandma?  There was.\n\nFriendly employees, good crowd, clean bathrooms, and I got to see Las Vegas KISS for free!",1
"Lisa was fantastic, my son was losing  weight, her advice helped instantly! She also gave me great advice about feedings and galactogues. She was even flexible with payment. I continue to call on her for all my breastfeeding advice.",1
"Do not know about the hotel but the bar at closer to the back is terrible. Walked in, sat by the bar with my wife sat for 10 min not a single bartender payed any attention to us. They were to busy smiling and chatting. Terrible service.",0
"I'm so sad that PT'S has taken over. I regularly order take out and usually get two cheesy potato soups in the bread bowl and a shepherd's Pie, which is also served in a bread bowl,  with mashed potatoes billowing out the top. I ordered my same order tonight and I got three plastic 6 Oz containers. The shepherd's Pie looked like someone threw up in a tiny cup. But the bill was the same as it always is.  So sad!! The smoke is so heavy that just in the  10 min I waited for my to go order,  I got into my car and smelled like an ash tray.",0
Good beer and food!,1
"This restaurant was recommended to us by a co-worker, mainly because of their $5.00 burger night and $5 appetizers and happy hour.  We have a special waitress, Carri,  who waited on us our first time and we always request her, however, have experienced other waitstaff and all of them are just as professional.  We have always had great service.  The first time my son and I tried it, we were hooked.  We come almost every Monday for $5 burgers and great appetizers ( fried zucchini is the best ).  My husband used to work out of town but now is in town and we go at least 2 times a week.  We go almost every Monday for burgers and usually Fridays for steak or  pizza or all you can eat fish.  As with any restaurant, we have our favorite foods, but have never been disappointed with anything we have tried.  We love that it is a locally owned establishment and will continue to enjoy their restaurant anytime we can and will also recommend them to our friends and family. They have a bar area, a dining area, and a patio.  Several TVs are available to enjoy different options for games.  The entire staff is friendly and  professional.  We have always experienced excellent service. We love Fat Willy's Chandler Heights.",1
"Update:After careful consideration, Timo's has reached out to me to indicate that they have removed their Foie Gras item.  I feel that this is a responsible decision based on their part and this reflects their standards as a business.  Therefore, I am removing my past rating and replacing them with what I truly feel that they deserve.  I will revisit and am more than positive that I will have a stellar dining experience.  Thank you, Timo's.",1
"I stayed Aria more than three times. Love their service, restaurants, casino and such but City Bar... It was the worst service experience I've ever had. \n\nMy SO and I went there after midnight. It was empty except a group of loud college guys sitting in the corner. The waitress walked passed us several times and wouldn't take our order. A sleazy fat guy with four call girls came in - the waitress was being friendly and attentive. She led them to the couch and took their orders. Uhhhhh, really??! We tried to get her attention and she intentionally ignored us again. The bouncer actually told us to leave without telling us why.\n\nWe weren't being rude or anything. Just simply trying to get their attention. ;p",0
"We've seen all the Vegas Cirque shows... This was a disappointment.  The \""""star\"""" of the show was the stage.  Otherwise, it was completely forgettable.",0
Great sushi great price I just wish that the sushi chefs would have some sort interaction with the customers. But if they keep making sushi taste this way they can ignore me all they want,1
"...NOW WE'RE TALKIN'! Killer Mexican Food! The chips 'n salsa kicks ass! You get a red, blue & regular tortilla chips with reg, spicy salsa & bean dip! Hellava start! A kick-butt margarita! Had Chicken Fajitas!...THE BEST! Cannot wait to return! Great ambiance.",1
"Yuck.  Premade ravioli, premade tasteless goopy white sauce, premade tasteless red sauce.    I don't pay money for canned food with no seasoning.  Strings lost me as a customer because when I asked the waitress about it, she said corporate made them use the premade sauces.",0
"Second time going there now, I have to say the menu sucks and I felt like shit when I left, but I laughed the whole time and I will be back next year.  On a side note, stick to the chicken fingers and have fun.",1
