0,Crawling under a rock to spare my ears the agony.....,"Ugh! From the fake smile on his CD single to the Barry Manilow-ish album cover, this guy screams superficiality! Sorry, Clay....you might have been second in American Idol II...but you are NOT Barry Manilow! I just have a problem with someone who has to use a tv show to get noticed instead of using their god-given talents and merits to get to superstardom. It smacks in the face of those who have real talent and are struggling to be heard and appreciated by the music industry and the public. So many good singers are passed up because of tripe like this. Please, spend your money wisely and don't buy this CD. Go out and get yourself ULTIMATE BARRY MANILOW or even a good Celine Dion disc instead. At least those folks worked for years to get where they are...and obviously have some talent. Clay, I wish you luck...but I am sure your career will be history in about a year."
1,Another rocking Weeds Season.,Yet another awesome season of Weeds. A must have it you have the other 3 seasons.
0,Not entirely original...,"Actually everything in the book IS helpful, and a OK read... but most of the material is FREE on the net already.The stuff from ""The Layguide"" was mirrored on all kinds of websites all over the place before it ever became print. If you search for keywords like ""layguide"" and ""player guide"" on the net, you will find this stuff is basically plagaurized. It was just a compilation of a bunch of usenet posts.Now, if you really want something in print, and original too, do yourself a favor now and go buy ""The Art of Seduction"" by Robert Greene, also available here on Amazon.com. The guy researched great seducers and seductions throughout history, and came up with types of seducers, the stages of seduction, etc. And his work is entirely original as well."
0,Don't waste your time on this edition!,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this particular Kindle version is broken: any passages in the original which appeared in italic type have failed to be transcribed, leaving large gaps in the narrative, especially at the beginning.Therefore I rate this edition one star."
1,A Jesse Stuart Harvest: My opinion of it,"A Jesse Stuart Harvest is a collection of stories by Jesse Stuart. All the stories bring out his personality and the talking of the Old West. This book also has an introduction that narrates the life of the author, Jesse Stuart.I think this book is really good because it takes you on a trip through time and into a world of adventure. My favorite story was Snake Teeth because it has a lot of cliffhangers and adventure. I would recommend this book for 9 yrs.-adults because normally after 9 years of age you will understand the dialect in this book."
1,Fantastic,"A movie that makes you feel a lot better about the holidays. Although not a childish movie, Eight Crazy Nights is a fantastic Sandler movie."
0,This movie is not all that,"originally i would give this horrible dipiction of The Odyssey 1 star, but because of one of the last scenes where ugly t(telemachus) threw two spears at once, i give it two stars. Everything was horrible to my opinion. The accents kept changing everything. If you read the book before you watched the movie, you would thinkt hat this was all a joke. So if anything just read the book by itself. So two stars for two stars thrown by ugly T"
1,"trashy, but quick and entertaining","I wouldnt call this a literary masterpiece or the best book that I have ever read, but I found it to be one of the most demanding--that I go back to it and finish as soon as possible!It's one of those literary candy novels that you can't put down. You will be up at night trying to find out who is sleeping with whom and killing whom next...The amount of sex in the book (without too much graphic detail) is numbing afterwards. It's almost as mundane as brushing one's teeth, after reading hundreds of pages on the role that sex plays in politics, weath, class, manipulation, etc.A harlequin story.Unbelievable society that Tudor was.So glad that women have it much better these days.The PILL did change history!"
0,A huge Adams fan finally must face reality.,"As a long-time Douglas Adams fanatic (read all 5 of the trilogy, at least a dozen time, even wrote down every noun in all 5 for a database,) I read both Last Chance to See and DGHDA and loved them. Then I read this sequel and had to admit that it was likely the worst book I'd ever encountered. I didn't laugh once and literally had to force myself through it with several lapses between readings. Odin and Thor bored me senseless. I can now understand why there's been no third addition to the series. Time wasted on this could have been much better spent working on yet another HHG novel."
0,A disappointing read for the 21st century,"This book is a classic. No question. That's why I chose to read it. When it came out in the 1860s, it was science fiction and gripped the imaginations of many. A ship that could travel under the water! But reading it in 2010, much of the novelty of the book has been realized. We have had submarines for nearly a century.But even aside from that, there is little plot to the novel. It reads as if it were written by a committee at National Geographic. It's a survey of all the unique items and places in the world's oceans. The little plot there is involves the protagonist trying to escape from the ship. And the ending (not to ruin it...) is a total cop-out and disappointing.I was hoping this book would stand the test of time, like The Time Machine or even Around the World in 80 Days. But I found it a rather boring and drudging read."
1,stealth movie,a movie that sneaks up on you. not a big budget. but an excellent film.and i like excellent films.
0,"Crap, Junk, Worthless, etc","The other 1-star poster is absolutely correct; these things are crap. I ordered two of them for both my kids and neither worked at all. The rockets didn't seal on the pump so no pressure could be pumped into them, thus making them useless. I had high hopes for this toy because of my love for it when I was younger. As always, the quality of these ""nostalgic"" toys leave much to be desired (I'm looking at you, Evel Knievel Dare Devil Stunt Set!). The price is cheap, but the quality is cheaper."
1,My favorite book of all-time,"I can still remember the force with which the first two or three paragraphs hit me, reading them in a bookstore in Albuquerque. Inventive, humane, human, magical."
1,Very important book,"This book is a very important must-read for every person living in America at this time in history. The paralells that can be drawn from the story in this novel to the ""dumbing of America"" that is going on today are quite unnerving, and quite scary. This book should be required reading for everyone who has ever turned on the television to escape from the world (which is just about everyone in this country)."
0,"Long Winded, Sand and Stars","There's one good chapter, a good story, about survival. Otherwise, the pretentious Frenchman force feeds the reader his personal philosophy through a superfluous writing style. His name matches his style, long-winded and pretentious."
0,Get with the times,"For those who don't want to be dragged into the new .net world. There is still asp...however, 2.0 is the old version, at least get 3.0"
1,"Well made, but depressing.","This is another ""artistic"" movie. The acting was very convincing and all the stuff they say about the powerful acting of Marlon Brando and the convincing youth and innocence of the one-hit-wonder girl that starred with him is valid. It was worth watching, but probably not worth owning. It's ultimately very depressing and doesn't really leave you holding on to anything. The sex scenes were pretty explicit, but not really anything you couldn't see in a 'hard-R' movie today. Buy it for the acting, not the story."
0,A True Stinker,"Cinematography is just ONE ingredient of a good film, not thewhole recipe. This was a story with so much promise, yet it insistedon becoming eye-candy rather than a good movie...... END"
1,"more than ""disco""","In the begining thier was house.......and before that thier was SALSOUL!!!! The root of house music started with salsoul. This cd captures some of the best songs that they produced. To say that this is just another disco cd, would be doing it a grave disjustice. It would be like calling the Mona Lisa just a painting or the statue of Dave just a rock. This is a compilation of the best dance music ever recorded. The blend of rebel rosing vocals and smooth lyrical contents with the monstrative rythems are timeless classics. My only regret is they didn't release all of thier gems out on one compliation. This is a must have for any disco, house, dance, or r&b collection."
1,Creepy old Anthony Hopkins film,"Magic stars Anthony Hopkins long before Silence of the Lambs. His character ""Corky"" is a magician who can't seem to catch a break. He decides to try his luck at using a ventriloquist doll during his act and he becomes a success. His ventriloquist partner ""Fats"" starts to take over Corky's thoughts and motives. The success that his act has brought him starts to push him further into insanity and he runs off to escape with Fats. It is at this point that Corky's weird life begins to fall apart. He finds his long lost love and her violent drunk husband when Fats decides to take over. I remember seeing this movie as a kid and it really scared me. Just the thought of a doll coming to life is a bit disturbing. Great movie!"
1,One of the best ever.....,"I have read this book 4 times, and I can read it 100 times more, and never get tired of it. This is what a great piece of literture can do. This book has such unforgetable scenes, that one cannot differenciate between dream and reality that exists in the story, but takes over your mind and don't let go till you set aside the book. And even after, you will be captivated by the imagineray that has gone into this masterpiece."
0,Not for everyone,"If your main objective, is the study of human relationships,social rapports between humans, and conquering and seducing otherpeople, this movie is for you.Not an embarrassing movie, at all, for any of the actors. Just,a nutty story, and enfatuation of the author of the script withpeople, relationships, seduction, etc.This is not to say that the above aspects are unimportant. Not true.Just that, perhaps a movie about such a theme might be more funfor some people than others."
0,disappointment,"I was a great fan of the Mr. Coffee MUG-ACTIVATED warmer. The ones I had finally gave out so I looked to buying more, and some for friends. I could find only the ""on/off switch"" warmer (although it was initially called ""mug-activated"" on the screen) so ordered 2. As already stated, the coffee is kept only warm, and you definitely have to remember to turn OFF the warmer or you could return hours later and find it still ON, which could be a danger. I have been unable to find a mug-activated warmer, but continue the search because I do not believe this ""on/off switch"" is any good."
0,Parents - Don't waste your money! Buy the GBA game,"I purchased the Red and Blue PETs for my son who loves the show. These toys don't work properly. My son carries it around as a prop but it too difficult for a child between 6-10 to understand. If your child wants a PET, but the GBA game Red Sun / Blue Moon. There is a build it PET that works. Kids can battle each other."
1,A classic with a beautiful wrapping,"Wonderful book, timeless advice... plus Maira Kalman!! Her exquisite illustrations pair wonderfully with this major classic."
0,Waste of money,"If you get to this review, please, please, do not spend your hard earned money on this toy, even at half price it is not worth it. I faced the same problems as everyone else, I'm forced to use my own glue and take time out to re work the toy so that it does what it was supposed to out of the box. A watse of money! Nuff Said!"
1,With Burning Hears Review,This is a great meditation on the Euchar5ist and its application to everyday life. I highly recommend it to believers (and others?)Ray Jorgensen
0,"1 was a sin, 2 was an atrocity, 3 lacks a word to describe its awfulness","When I saw a review giving this movie 0 out of 5 (the 3rd time this respected source has ever done so), I should have listened. If 2 had plot holes, 3 has plot chasms. There is no story. A few special effects can not redeem such gaping wounds that make up the rest of the film (plot, charisma, fan service). Michael Bay really needs to stop raping people's childhoods (a la South Park George Lucas style).Go watch the '86 animated film instead and save yourself the excruciating pain that is The Dark Side of the Moon (and I'm not talking Pink Floyd)."
0,Travel water bowl best suited to smaller breeds,"I gave this a two star rating based on the fact that mine was to be used for a larger dog. This product would be adequate for a small dog. But the opening for a dog with a larger muzzle is not large enough. The claims for not spilling water seem to be true. However, since only about an inch of water is in the bottom of the opening at any time, it's more difficult for a larger dog to get his nose in and get a good drink. I guess if the dog were extremely thirsty and had no other water supply, this could do in a pinch."
0,Too Expensive,"I used it once and have not touched it since, the dolfin wont stay on my clit and the clear stuuf is too soft, Waste of MONEY"
0,I was expecting different,The music is too loud for me but I will send to to friend like that type of stuff
0,I won't buy one again,"I have had mine for about two years. I love the color it gives but it has also given me a lot of problems. Something has gone wrong with the memory inside making it impossible to print in ""best"" quality. An error message will pop up on my screen and then it will start printing out garbled junk. I've down loaded the latest driver--more than once--but with no success. It has been a waste of money to me--especially when ink cartridges are so high for it!!"
0,did not survive battery change,"Its light was okay, although it could not quite cover an entire page of a book. The main problem is it's too shabby to survive a battery change--so you will get just 40 hours of use before it runs out. Also, finding 3V Lithium batteries is not easy."
1,A mob classic!,"This is a great movie! If you are into mob movies, this is a must-have. It is a classic and the cast of actors is incredible."
1,Start here,"These three discs are a perfect place to begin your Stereolab collection as it covers a wide cross section of ""the stereolab sound"".And the music...??? just look up the individual disc reviews on Amazon.It's all there....Enjoy"
0,An unbelievable waste of time.,"As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel, I would like to say that despite my understanding and comprehension of the book, I still found it entirely dull, boring, and a waste of my time. Since it was required of me to read this book in school, I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter, but I would have never on my own time, and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective, it would make more sense, but in order to understand its symbolism, one still has to read it, and it is really not worth it."
0,horrible,"Bought it one and half year ago from Circuit city. Used it mainly for general computer work, not gaming. When I upgraded to a newer machine and try to install it on it, has problem with driver on XP Media Center edition, can not record MIDI from my Yamaha keyboard, and they don't provide support for it any more. What kind of business is this vendor in? Only one and half year later, they don't provide any technical support for their products."
0,read VICSARJOO's review - more entertaining than the film,"I could hardly believe this film was being high-listed for possible DVD release during the Amazon.com voting... let's be honest, it is not that good a movie (neither acting nor plot nor cinematography), unless you have an intense need to see some gymnastics and Kurt Thomas. But do make a point of reading VICSARJOO's review, for a delicious satire of over-blown and mis-guided reviews. If you enjoy that review (one of my favorites) there are some other classics by him if you link to his other reviews, though some seem a little half-hearted compared to this review by him. Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death is another fine example of his dry wit. Thank you VICSARJOO for making me smile."
1,Canada Green Grass Seed,"So far, so good! It's taking longer than I thought it would, but we still have a ways to go."
1,Great Product!!,"I bought this for my youngest son's third birthday. It is a great product! Both of my boys, (ages 3 and 6) love to play with it. It is a good outside or inside toy but to use it outside there can not be much wind because it is very light and will blow around easily. To use inside you do need lots of room. It can be put together or taken apart in less than 5 minutes so it is a toy you can buy even if you don't have room to always leave it up. I would recommend this toy to anyone. It would be a great toy for a baby just learning to craw."
0,A fine game once - but it will not run on modern Macs,"This is a PowerPC game. Up through Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), Intel Macs had ""Rosetta,"" a technology for running PowerPC binaries on Intel machines.Apple discontinued Rosetta in Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), so there is not way to run this game (or any other PowerPC binaries) without emulating earlier versions of Mac OS X, or booting an earlier version on your Mac (which might not be possible with machines released after Lion). So do not buy it unless you are familiar with these issues.Caveat Emptor."
0,Save Your $ For Something Worth While,"Like so many others I wasn't going to comment on either of these books but some of the recent reviews pleading with people to read it makes me sick. Begging people to read this? DO read the reviews however AND DO read them with a grain of salt the good obviously are there to promot the book,but many of the not so good reviews are there to promote it too. Don't fall for this and waste money lining this author's pockets. I rate this as NEGATIVE -5 star! Don't buy this book! You are better off without it."
0,Three Days of Use and It Broke,"Very disappointed in this product. It worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated. It was very inexpensive so I did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange, so the company would do nothing when they sent me an inquiry as to product satisfaction."
1,sergeant frosts lonely hearts club band,"edith has created a venue for herself to exorcise melancholic memories with painful melodies. there are no disguises on this collection. lonesome guitars and medicinal piano radiate the mood of broken spirits. she writes all her own songs. these ballads are definite reminders of those unbearable moments we all have to live. they are all gray sky, secluded,isolating tunes. i envision a ironical pace. i thought she was from chicago, millions and millions of people, and she sings stark loneliness"
1,Louie's Goose,"A good childrens' book, excellent for reading to pre-school aged children. The text can easily be understood by the 3 and 4 year olds in my library story hour as they identify with Louie and his most favorite stuffed animal, a red goose. The illustrations are great!"
0,Too Small,"This brooch is far too small and expensive for its size. I was shocked when I pulled it out of its pouch. May I iterate, it is far too small. Without a moment's hesitation this brooch was immediately returned."
1,Worth Every Penny!,"What can I say, the chapter on setting up your jointer is worth the price of the book by itself. The pictures and the diagrams are great, easy to understand, and the text is informative and easy to read. This book makes you a better woodworker, because your tools will be correctly set up, which also makes them more fun to use and much safer.I would recommend this book to you, even if you do not own the tool, but are looking at getting into woodworking, with this book you will be better able to understand how the various tools work, and you can buy decent used tools and tune them up, saving you a bundle!Great book!!"
1,"For those who love to read, the ""Lonely Hunters""","I always love delving into a well-written, even complex book and getting into the minds of the characters. I was not bored or disappointed at all by this book. It is a book that will appeal to those who feel caught between ""irony and faith,"" or for people who are searching for truth and something to give a lonely life fulfillment."
0,Not quite...,"Tremors 2 doesn't live up to what I had hoped for. The movie has its funny moments, but just doesn't hook the viewer like the original. A key ingredient missing in this movie is Kevin Bacon. If you haven't seen the first Tremors, I would strongly recommend NOT viewing the sequel. However, if you enjoyed the first one, the sequel may be worth your time."
1,My floors are always cleaned with a CLEAN mop now!,"I do think this item works great as a mop and as a dust mop, it really picks up all of the hair, fuzz and dust. Sadly(this is why it isn't 5 stars), corners and edges will find you using a regular broom, instead of this gadget, as it just can't handle those areas. I love that I can throw the pads in the washer and let them air dry -- no more mopping with anything less than clean."
1,Read the Fineprint,"Overall, this is a good collection of gospel and spiritual music... I would not, however, have called it a soundtrack when , aside from the classic theme song, is music that helped inspire the creation of the show.The standout track, to me, was Amy Grant's contribution."
1,good movie,"I have tried to watch this movie several times on TV, but always either miss the beginning or have to stop watching it before it's over. I was so glad to find this available in DVD. I was able to watch it in its entirety, without commercials. It's a very good movie. I highly recommend it."
0,It didn't help my vision,"I followed this book and did everything it said with an open mind. The print is every bit as blurry as it every was before I tried the things in this book. I wanted so much for this to work, and I'll try again, but after four months of daily applying the techiniques of this book, my vision did not improve the least bit."
1,Destination Unknown,"Destination Unknown by Mest, is such a great CD, their songs are songs that people can relate to, and the catchyness of the songs will stick in your head. This Cd is by far the best cd i've heard yet."
1,good diaper,"These are good diapers that don't leak, even with overnight soakings. They don't hold up to blowouts as well as huggies little movers, however."
1,Good Entetainment,"Just a fun movie. Never made it big in the movies but an enjoyaable experience overall. Some swearing but it fits -- not just for the sake of using the F word which, incidentally, is never used."
0,Mr Coffee mug warmer,I have used a Dazey and it worked great. The Mr Coffee keeps it a little warm but I like my coffee hot.
1,non stop adventure,"This was a great and is very magical. A young boy's nanny is leaving and gives him a small castal as a going away present but it turns out that the night that came w/the castal is a real night that has been shrunken and turned to stone. The young boy breaks the spell that an evil sorcerer has put on the night and goes back to his time to stop the wrong that the sorcerer is doing. Will he stop the evil sorcerer or will the evil sorcerer stop him, you will find out in this incredible story of magic and adventure!!!"
0,I'd rather stick razors into my mouth,"Maybe it was my bad to buy a knockoff product that was so cheap. Compared to Gum brand picks, Doctor's BrushPicks are unusable. The picks have no flexibility or give. Maybe I could use them to clean out tiny metal machine parts."
0,Very slow,"Turtledove certainly has a good grasp of history but the quality of his writing is only so-so. When you combine this with a very long plot development and stereotypical characters it is almost impossible to finish one volume, let alone all four. An editor would have been useful but perhaps the publisher figured enough people would keep paying for the whole series that no editing was needed."
1,Untitled,I love this movie so much. I have been watching it for years and I have yet to grow tired of it. It is a great movie with beautiful songs and music. The story-line will capture you. This is definately one of MY favorite movies.
0,Review,"I had neutral feelings torwards this book. I didn't hate it, but I didnt like it. I thought the book was rather boring and was hard for me to get into. I did like how the story was easy to understand and follow. I do like that about books. I did not like how the book ended. In all the book wasn't bad but it was not my kind of book I would chose to read."
0,"Repetition, repetition, reputation","Wonderful series prior to this. Shelters of Stone, however, tarnishes Jean M. Auel's reputation. Quite frankly, I don't believe she wrote it herself."
0,Bad product.,This product really sticks. I bought a couple days ago and then had to return it. I couldn't even set up the VNP because there was no proper documentation. I call Netgear and their support was no help at all. The router couldn't work wirelessly and wired simultaneously for the same machine... without reset the router... What I am trying to say is if you connected wirelessly to the router and then disconnected that wireless connection and then plugged into the router with your wired LAN cable... you would not have a connection. Unless you went into the the router wirelessly and resetted it manaully. The latest firmware upgrade they have for the router is a beta v1.2 - And if you have a a problem with beta versions of their firmware you cannot call them (Netgear).... you have to email .... beta@netgear.com or something like that. It does have alot of cool features but there are too many glitches. Hope this review helps.
1,Sony Hi8 Camcorder with 2.5 LCD,"I believe I will be very happy with the camcorder. Its small,light and easy to handle.The LCD is clear and bright.Ease of operation."
1,So sweet!,Kept my 2 year old interested which is hard to do!!! The ending is. Little weird bc it feels lime something is missing but cute movie overall!
1,Great Remote Mount Radio,"This radio has the same features that most $300+ radios have, yet it's less than $100. The full channel scanning and DualWatch work great and to be such a compact unit with such a small speaker the audio sounds good. If you will be driving with the windows down go ahead and plan for an external speaker but for any other time the built in speaker works great. Once setup with a tuned antenna the transmit and receive are both great. A great radio for a great value!"
0,Picture Looks Much Better Than Product,"If I had opened the box before I gave the Club Champ Putt 'n Return Putting Mat as a gift, I would have returned it. Disappointed in the quality and durabiity. Would not recommend."
1,YesYore,"Judicious choice of tracks by Steve Howe makes a seemingly inessential purchase (how many best-of's/repackagings from the band in recent years?) hard to pass up. Disdaining the live tracks, solo meanderings (The Fish?), and subpar B-sides that afflicted Yesyears, this 6-hour package sounds and looks great. Nothing (incl. America) is abridged, and liner notes make a strong case for Yes rivaling King Crimson as musical pioneers. Packaging, as always with Rhino, is exemplary."
0,Broke down in 3 weeks,Product just quit working 3 weeks after I got it. Sent it back to manufacturer (Garmin) who said they would have it fixed on a priority and over-nighted back to me. That was almost two weeks ago and have not gotten it back yet. Still waiting.
1,Transitions,"I am an avid fan of DM, and will do the best job at being objective about their work. Although, I think this album is great and it has many quintessential DM songs, there are some songs that I often skip over. These songs are definitely not my favorites, but I think mostly that they just don't appeal to me in the context of this album. This is why I label this ""transitions"". I love all periods of DM, but I notice this one seems to be one that incorporates the earlier ""new wave"" feeling of previous albums but also ushers in the darker era of DM. I tend to prefer the darker DM, but appreciate the earlier work especially if not simultaneously. If you are even a slight fan of their work, you will enjoy this album."
0,Avoid it.,"The abridged version of this book would read as so:""Sin is inevitable. So make the best of bad situations. And oh by the way... women are strong.""There ya go. Nuff said. I don't need to read obnoxiously long sentences lamenting on one sentiment for the entire 160 odd pages or so of this travesty. The entire book is just one big complaint. From the girl who commits adultery. She laments about it for the whole stinking book and puts up with some obnoxious kid the for whole thing as well. Painfully thick language, stupid storyline, quixotic style... everything that would piss off a recreational reader. Avoid it."
0,"Love Jerry and Dean, just not this version","I was very disappointed with this....I realize it is a 1950 film, however, the sound and picture were off much if not all of the film. Additionally, it wasn't listed as a DVD-R, but is. Wish it had been a better quality production with sound and picture in sync as I really wanted it for my collection."
0,Plain Putrid,"This book is so obscene in some parts, and its not even written by Naomi Campbell, but some filthy man. Dont pick up this book if you want your brain to be burnt away by the promiscious literary flop of some freak."
1,A Great Book on a Sports Legend,"This book was excellent. The author gives us an intimate portrait of one of the greatest and most colorful athletes of the 20th century: Babe Ruth. Overall, we learn a lot about him and baseball during the roarong 20's into the 30's.My only issue was that I didnt like the way the book abruptly ended with his death. I would have liked to have read more about his funeral and the aftermath of his death. Plus I would have liked to learn more about how his legacy was treated the years after his death.Nevertheless, this book is a great read and I highly recommend it to any baseball or sports fan."
1,"Really good miniseries, but Amazon let me down","I bought this from Amazon in July. Unfortunately, I only opened it last week to find out it was a defective on the first disk. It played the first and third episodes perfectly but the second episode had 20 minutes of skipping. Amazon has absolutely no way of reporting this after your window of return has expired. So buyer beware. If you are slow to view your DVD's you can be screwed. I have always had good luck with Amazon until now.The series is excellent and quite intriguing until the end. I enjoyed it despite the skipping in the middle."
1,"""Souless Pop?"" Not here","When I was sick a few weeks ago my brother bought me this cd. Just one spin and I was hooked. What a pleasent surprise! I was expecting heartless trash with the ""lou pearlman"" sound to it. (remember o-town??"" This cd is definatly nothing like that. The main singer (Guthrie) wrote most of the songs himself. Along with the fact the group does not do choreographed dancing. (Is it me or is anybody else sick of that??) The ratings are out of a scale of 1-4Ohh its kinda crazy- 3 1/2No one does it better- 4 (great harmonies)I don't need anyone- 3Feelin' You- 3 1/2Faded- 4 (everyones fav; wassup sarah?)Lets do it right- 3Only in my mind- 3.5Stay- 4Baby come back- 3Gravity- 2.5Next Time- 4*In memory of Michael Cuccione of 2gether 1985-2001*"
0,Wow bad even by DeCoteau standards,A real time waster. Not even decent underwear scenes for those who buy these things for that.
1,great classic book,this book came on time and was in good condition. It has been on my list of books to read for a very long time
0,"A trashy, macho bodice-ripper for guys.","When I started reading Birds of Prey, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and setting. Then I started groaning at the incredibly predictable behavior of the cardboard cutout characters. By 1/4 of the way through, I found myself hypnotized by the parade of every stereotypical character I remember from the trashy adventure books I loved when I was 12. The young, perfect hero. His loyal negro sidekick. The noble, tragic father. The backstabbing piratical villain. The fat, ugly, cowardly, corrupt, rich villain. The cruel villain who is, however, a ""true warrior"". The sultry temptress. The beautiful imprisoned princess. A half-dozen more plot elements which I won't reveal for fear of spoiling the book. In every way, at best an average book."
0,MOIVES ON PARADE! DO NOT ORDER-ITS WORST COPY OF HOBBIT,"I have seen this moive over 1000 times and thats no exageration! being born in 1972 I remember this film in the theatres and has been a favorite ever since and is a FAMILY FAVORITE with my kids today.This ""THE HOBBIT:THE ORIGINAL UNEDITED 1977 ANIMATED CLASSIC"" as advertised it a complete lie, the film is edited and missing scences,not whole scences mind but enough to make it seem it was chopped to be compadible for T.V. and its commercials to fit in a time slot, not only that the colar is quite faded and not sure if it is due to a poor quality DVD that the moive was downloaded/recorded on but there is a glich, a repeator skip of 1.5 second as Bilbo spaeks to Gandalf and others....I will never order on Amazon again, HOW CAN THEY CALL IT THE ORIGINAL UNEDITED CLASSIC WHEN IT IS NOT!SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR THE REAL VERSION!!!"
0,Embarrassing Ebook,"After reading the Kindle sample of this book, I have to agree with the many critical reviews of this edition. This is not a review of the writing, which is excellent, but of this electronic edition of the title.Aside from the fact that $15 for the electronic edition of a book that is over 40 years old and has already been widely published as a mass market paperback for for half the price is obscene, the quality of this Kindle edition is so horrible I would not want it if it was free. DUNE is one of the great classics of scifi literature but this ebook is an embarrassment to both the publisher and the author and I would urge anyone interested in reading this book to pass on this edition. Instead, find any one of the cheap tens of thousands of used copies that are easily available of this title."
1,Classic,"There's nothing bad to say about this book! Everyone should read it before they die. Great, entertaining book for anyone."
1,Very Cool,I ordered this mainly to learn some Knots. This is nice to throw in the backpack and take out for a camping trip. Use the examples to try out some knots.Good product. Very useful.
0,Must be made in China,"I purchased this for my step-daughter who is a poker novice. I thought she would like to have her own poker set to play and practice. One week after receiving it, she informed me that the set already began falling apart. The hinge came off and it's literally falling apart on her.This was embarrassing because it was a gift from me. Now I must redeem myself and purchase a better set. Do not buy this piece of junk."
1,Hard questions....Real Answers,"This book asks some hard questions in the way it scrutinizes the bible. Reverend Teel then answers the questions in a way that makes sense and gives a real understanding of the possibilities. The book asks the reader to set aside all preconceived notions on religion, Jesus, and God and take a look at it in a most unique way. I went into the book on the defensive as a fundamentalist Christian and found myself following the argument of Reverend Teel and even, at moments, agreeing with him. While I certainly don't agree with all of the points he brings out, he does bring up some really good questions and gives some really provocative and thought provoking answers. He asks the reader only to keep an open mind and in the end I was moved by the book, I'm recommending it to all of my friends."
1,When Already?,"Like others here, I'm wondering if the final seasons of one of the most durable, laugh-out-loud sit-coms of all timewill ever be released. I bought Season 1 for a song when Borders went out of business,expecting a series I loved at the time to have dated badly. It hadn't.A great cast, with fine, funny writers and performed (I believe) before a live audienceI quickly caught up and, like the rest of you, have a feeling that I've pre-ordereda box-set that, inexplicably, will never be released. When already? Ever?"
0,Somewhat worked for 30 days....now starting to fail,"Update...so the workaround described below work for about 33 days...just outside the return window. The tracks that play in just the left headset channel do not come through. I've tried 2 sets of ear buds and one set of over the ear headsets...all have the same issue. Plug the same headsets into the source (PC), all channels play out of both ear.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS ITEM.---Out of the box, if I plug my ear buds from my iPhone into the extension (fully connected in the female end) I only get sound out of the right ear bud. Verified the same condition with a pair of JVC ear buds as well. I have found if you insert the male end of the headphones into the extender to the first ""click"" (not fully inserted), sound comes from both ear buds. There is tension with it connected in this fashion, so it works but could be better. Others may have better luck with other headphones."
0,Umm... Nah,"Well this movie started off semi-enjoyable. An early shower scene of Reese Witherspoon made me happy. Thie movie sets up with a father-daughter conflict that you've seen in hundreds of other movies. Enter Marky Mark, sweeping the girl off her feet. Then comes the part when the girl argues a lot with the father. And so on... we've all seen this before. It seems like the writer ran out of ideas at the end of the movie, though. Or perhaps he was getting bored with all the build-up he was creating with the characters that he was just like ""Alright, screw the rest of the plot, lets get to the action."" And so he does. And soon after the movie ends at a seemingly premature 1hr. 16min. Woohoo.Don't waste your money on this DVD, or even the rental, they play it all the time on USA or the like."
0,Neither Savage or Sensuous,I must admit that the title caught my attention. Sad to say the music won't. It reminded me of being in a department store elevator stuck in the mezzanine and unable to get out. You can save yourself. If you want good exotica buy a Les Baxter CD.
1,ANOTHER GREAT ADDITION TO THE COLLECTION !!!!!!,Not as magical and is darker than the first 3 movies. Overall it was a great movie!!!The ending leaves you anxious to see the next film!!!
1,Great for the summer,"My daughter is living with a couple for the summer. This was an alternative to transporting a regular twin bed 80 miles to their house. She has been very pleased with the quality and ease of use. That is a big deal with her as she has two steel rods in her back. As a college student and missions student, I'm sure it will be used again."
1,Terrific Reference for Identifying Butterflies,"Is that a monarch, a viceroy or a queen butterfly? To identify butterflies look through the Field Guide to Butterflies of Texas. The next time, you can tell that it was a tiger swallowtail and not a zebra swallowtail or a spicebush swallowtail.Children are fascinated by insects and butterflies as well. Teach them to appreciate nature. Learning the names of butterflies is a good way to start."
0,*Thumbs Down*,"This cd isn't TOO bad but at the same time I wish i hadn't bought it. I think the singer said to himself ""Let's see how i can ruin this record by whining like a country singer all emotionally"". (And in a realllly bad way) Oddly enough, the absolute best song these guys ever put out isn't featured on either of their cd's. (Sweet Summer) Besides the fact that this is missing that gem of a song, it's nothing like the first cd. Nothing quite like the cathy pop rhythms of Don't Stop on this cd. Just kinda BLAND soft rock. I recommend downloading Sweet Summer as it is their best song by FAR and perhaps possibly buying the first cd, but don't waste your time on this one."
1,Great book!,This book gives a great look into the Jewish mindset of the early 1900s. A must read for any young Bible student.
1,Decent CD,"The Remake of Boyz-n-the-Hood makes this CD worth buying by itself, but there are some other catchy tunes that are worth listening to also."
1,Nice Family Drama,This is a nice family drama that explores a son's conflicted relationship with his father. It shows the sad consequences that result when father's spend much time trying to become rich and famous and calously neglect to care for and love their sons.
0,Disappointing,"I absolutely loved the first two Anne movies. When I heard they were finally making another movie, I was very excited to see it. I was extremely disappointed that the movie thoroughly strayed from L.M. Montgomery's enchanting story line. The story line was nothing like the true story of Anne, and although some may think it is a good movie in its own way, it is not worthy to carry the name Anne of Green Gables. The plot of this movie held no interest for me, and was extremely disappointing."
0,Disappointed,"This video was let down. The historical blurb at the beginning is a time waster, and a pain to fast forward thru every time I want to practice dancing. I agree with other reviewers regarding the time devoted to ""freestyle"" and ""improvisation"". I am too new at this to recognize the moves when they are put together so quickly- and without any commentary. I find myself struggling during this part, or worse - just standing there feeling frustrated and foolish. Some instruction regarding transitions from one move to another would have been appreciated. On the positive side, the actual breakdown of moves was very helpful, especially the belly roll and undulations. I was really struggling with those, and I'm now confidently on my way. I wish they had covered more moves in that manner. Bottom line- it's been a week, and I'm already seeking out another video to buy."
0,"1, and thats being generous....","I have read many of Jack Higgins' books and this is the poorest so far, in my humble belief. As I travelled thro' the pages it just got harder and harder to believe the simplicity with which Mr Dillon strolls thro' the events at hand. The story also lacks any imagination and could probably have been summed up in a short story. Mr Dillon is just to sci-fi I'm afraid.There is a quote at the start of the book and as I got near the final chapters, I was starting to imagine that the Author would be writing the finale of Mr Dillon....the quote read""To Tess, who thinks it's about time""Author, I think she may mean something else...."
0,Big disappointment!!!,"Bought it and was a bit disappointed. I thinkthat Clay should stick to his own style andstop trying to be someone he's not. The songsjust didn't do it for me.Certainly not the Clay Aiken that sold platinumwith his first CD. Wonder how that happened???????Spend your money of something worth while, butif you just got to have it, burn yourself acopy from a Clay fanatic who is sure to havea few extras on hand."
1,Good Anime,"If your a fan of the games you will enjoy the anime watching the familiar characters I like the dubbing I am a dubb person I perfer it, so its rare I ever complaint about it. Good series having played the games you will enjoy it more. Art style is diffrent its a good different nice change . For the price I paid 13 bucks its worth it"
1,Well Worth Acquiring!,"Pianist John Hicks has long been a master of the modern mainstream without necessarily blazing any new paths of his own. On this CD he is featured on a pair of solo numbers, a duet with flutist Elise Wood (a sensitive version of Duke Ellington's ""Star Crossed Lovers""), a trio rendition (with bassist Curtis Lundy and drummer Cecil Brooks III.) of ""Mood Swings,"" with a quintet (a blazing version of ""My Shining Hour"" that has both Bobby Watson and Vincent Herring on altos) and five selections with the full sextet. Four standards follow six obscurities (including Charles Mingus' ""Diane""). Hicks, who often shows off the influence of McCoy Tyner's voicings, has never recorded an uninspired record and this one is better than average for him. Due to the variety of moods, instrumental colors and settings, the music is continually interesting and well worth acquiring."
1,Charles Mann's 1491: well-written and fascinating,"My first purchase for my Kindle FireKindle Fire, Full Color 7"" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fiwas the perfect choice. Mann's research of indigenous people living in the Americas prior to Columbus' arrival was thorough and his conclusions well-balanced."
1,Comfortable,"I bought this air mattress after researching the site. It is indeed very comfortable and easy to operate and most important of all, NO LEAKING!!!"
1,awesome book to explain death to children,The book is great. Just watch out for the shipping especially if you want to order more than 1. You cant do it without paying double the shipping... bad rip off.
1,great card,"This card has to be the bast purchase I've ever made! The grapghics are great, it's DirectX supported (a biggie) and is far superior to most cards of the same price. The reviewer who says it doesn't work obviously knows nothing about computers to know well enough whether his motherboard will work with the card. If he bought the AGP card, maybe he should try the PCI. Anyway, this is a great video card from a great company for a great price. BUY IT!"
1,"If you are a entrepreneur, you must read this book","I wanted to start my own business, but I knew nothing about entrepreneurship. After reading this book, I feel confident about my new business venture. It is impossible to explain how valuable a tool this book is."
0,"Sad to say I didn't like this book... I really wanted to, but I just dont!","I bought this book thinking it was similar to the Harry Potter series (in nature and spirit) but I was very wrong. The characters are acceptable, but the author did a poor job of developing the Kit character... Also the writing is exceedingly dull, the story slogs along at an incredibly SLOW pace...Truthfully I found the story boring... but I read it anyway. I will not be reading the rest of the series.I think the writer's biggest mistake is trying to write the ""magic"" as if it were scientifically possible, and she spent way too much time trying to do so... Newsflash! Its MAGIC>>> you know fantasy, you don't need to make it or prove it... fantasy is simply a world that doesn't need explaining or proving.I think someone very young might like this book, but I did not. I am moving on to another series that has better writing."
1,This highly surprising telling....,...of one of the oldest mysteries in England was thoroughly enjoyable. The story is told in an intelligent manner and seems to logically solve the mystery. Until I read another theory on these two little princes I find more believable I'll stick with this one!
1,Tivo Wirelss G,"Ordered on same day as Tivo but came 8 - 10 days later. Caused a delay in hooking up. It would helpful to ensure shipping at the same time, especially when one unit is dependant on the other. Unit dropped off line after the first installation and had to be rebooted. Seems to be OK now.This is my first Tivo and adapter so I have nothing to compare this product with."
0,"Great printer, unless you're using Vista","I like this printer a lot and would probably have given it 5 stars, but it gets a major demerit thanks to the fact that it does not work with computers running Vista. HP will not be releasing the drivers until July of this year. So if you want to print now and not wait six months, and you've already upgraded to Vista, I recommend getting a different printer. Hopefully HP will get the message and release some drivers. Vista has been in beta for a long time, so I find this delay to be inexcusable."
0,Somewhat Overrated,"The Hobbit is considered a literary classic for the fantasy standards it created, and though there's a wonderful story here (the Riddles in the Dark chapter with Gollum is particularly exciting), but I was turned off by the quick writing style that emphasizes innane background details and cordially dances past what could have been epic sequences. For example, we get a full paragraph or two describing Bilbo's Hobbit hole, yet a measly sentence or so describing a battle in a thunderstorm between giant rock monsters. The Hobbit is an imporant piece, and many will undoubtedly love it, but I found it difficult to enjoy."
1,A timeless classic that's an unforgettable must-read.,"This is the timeless classic which the term ""Orwellian"" and""Big Brother"" are derived. This terrifying look into apossible future in which the Government ""Big Brother"" holdstotal control over the populace. Orwell's vision of thefuture still holds very true to this day and is a must-readfor anyone concerned about the future of technology andgovernmental control.-Hans Chen"
1,Great book,Loved kindle for iPad can't go wrong I buy as many books as possible this way. Quick down load and you get your stuff right away
0,Oh Please!,"Not another one again! I just don't understand Mr Grisham's maniacal obssesion with juries. Who knows how many lawyer and jury books the guy has written? All I know is this: I'm sick and tired of reading about these dumb juries! The Runaway Jury was the only thing that was anywhere near decent that Grisham has poured from his stinking pen. Why does he think the average Joe is interested in judicial matters. I, for one, am not."
1,Saw the,movie MANY years ago. Loved it then and loved the story as I read it. Times were tough by our standards but attitudes were good and mostly positive. Good read.
1,Building up steam...,"Thefirst volume of Gasarakireally surprised me. It was well written and thoughtful, trying to tell a deep story that was more about behind the scenes power plays than robot brawls.This second disc continues to add new wrinkles and complications. The war with Belgistan comes to a close (which surprised me as I thought it was going to run through the entire series) and the JSSDF forces prepare to pull out. We learn about a secret organization calling itself Symbol that was assisting Belgistan, though their motivations for doing so are still clouded.Yushiro causes some commotion when he heads off base and winds up in the middle of a kidnapping. We also see more of the mysterious girl from the first disc that seems to share Yushiro's powers.Very little seems to happen episode by episode. If the disc is watched straight through it is very satisfying viewing, but I can see that if I were watching this half an hour at a time as it was broadcast it would have been tough to follow."
1,As good as the guy's new book on Horatio Nelson.,"I read Antony Beevor which got me hooked on Stalingrad, and this book is as good as Beevor's. It is also as good as Hayward's new book on Admiral Nelson. Both get my high praise. Scholarly works that are also readable are few and far between, so make the most of this guy's work."
0,Had to buy it,I was forced to buy this for a grad class and it was absolutely boring. I was happy with the price and that's about it.
0,FIRMWARE FIXED IT,I just updated to the newest firmware (1.5 4/12/2007) and the disc is now PLAYABLE in my XA2. Big relieve for all I hope. Review of the source to follow.
0,Plastic limitations,"When I got the product and opened the box, the literature said that you cannot use the kind of shower head that has a valve that turns off the flow. This is because the filter housing is plastic and is subject to cracking or bursting if you turn off the flow downstream from the filter.That's the kind of shower head I have, and I like to use the valve feature. I really really wish that eGeneralMedical had said this in their (limited) online literature. And they expect me to pay the return shipping and a 15% restocking fee!"
1,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES MADE,"Please come out with a DVD version of this masterpiece as soon as possible. I saw this movie many years ago, and never thought I'd see it again. If it had not been for all your reviews, I would not have known it was this movie. Yes, this is the ultimate 'primitive' movie...definitely much better than 'Clan of the Cave Bears'. Here are the things you'll see : hairy cavemen, cannibals, neanderthals, sabre-tooth tigers, mammoths, pigmies, great landscapes and sceneries. The movie will humble you and make you think how precious the most basic necessities of life really is. You'll experience love, sex, tribal wars, sadness, humor. And for the last time, forget the historical experts that always claim some movie is bad because its historically inaccurate. I won't trade this movie for 99% of the Hollywood movies out there today!"
1,fireplace tool set,Good product. Got it in a timely manner. Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Not too expensive and just as good as the rest of the tools that are over priced. The tools work great and have been used a lot this winter.
1,Office Space (1999),"This movie is for anyone who has suffered a printer jam, worked next to someone loud and annoying, had a boss from Hell. This movie will get you to laugh. Especially enjoyable on particularly bad week at work (preferably cubical style)."
0,"Good idea, but not practical","We bought this so that the stroller could have shade from the front. It was hard to put on and keep stable, and the parts broke easily. Not worth it!"
1,Clear and tremendously helpful!,"I've been studying Arabic from a variety of sources, and this book has clarified much of the grammar I was confused about. I wouldn't recommend it for beginners, but for those who need to clarify Arabic's overwhelming grammar rules and review and organize what you may have learned in your courses, it's tremendously helpful. Its layout is simple and straightforward, and the exercises are helpful too."
1,Any true Allman Borthers fan would enjoy this DVD,The sound and picture quality are great and the selection of tunes are great also. The only annoying thing was the cut in interviews in the middle of a few songs. Overall a good DVD
1,"A ""MUST READ"" for all Home Inspectors!",This book is the premiere reference book for new Home Inspectors. The authors' knowledge is based on thousands of inspections. The layout and style of the book make it very easy to read and reference. There is a lifetime worth of valuable home inspection information at a very reasonable cost. MUST READ
1,THE FRENCH CONNECTION,"DEFINITELY KEEPS YOUR INTEREST. IT CONTAINS SO MANY DIFFERENT FACETS THAT ONE WANTS TO VIEW IT SEVERAL TIMES OVER, JUST SO THAT YOU HAVEN'T MISSED ANYTHING!"
0,Dissapointment,"AFter waiting so long I felt cheated after reading this book which could have been summarized in one sentence. Ayla reaches final destination, mates, and has Jondalar's baby. The rest of the book is totally plagarist from the other books in the series. All the events are exactly the same, just the names are changed. There was absolutely no new plots involved. What a shame."
1,good overall toy,"this is a very fun boat overall. it isn't very fast, but it has great range and it's batteries last a long time. the only problem with the battery system is that it takes 6 AA batteries and u keep having to get new ones. I also recommend bringing it to a place with no waves so the boat doesn't tip. Overall, this is a very good boat for its price and especially good for younger children."
0,Disco Queen,"Queen loved to experiment. Every time they released a new song, I would hear it and say (in delight), ""Is that Queen?"" However, this album abandoned all that was Rock and Roll and gave into the pop craze of disco that can only be classified as the dark ages in pop music. The only bright spot from this album was ""Under Pressure."" Thankfully, they pulled out of it to cement themselves as one of the greatest rock bands of all time."
1,Riveting Story of Survival (and Death) at Sea,"This is one of my favorite books of all time. The shocking sinking of the Essex (the inspiration for Moby Dick) is only the beginning of what the author turns into a gut-wrenching tale of a handful of sailors desperately trying to stave off starvation, thirst and madness as they try to make it from the middle of the Pacific back to South America. Philbrick's writing is clear, powerful and incredibly engaging. It's a hard book to both put down and get out of your mind after finishing it."
1,Undiscovered Treasure,"I believe Shirley Horn and this CD are an undiscovered treasure. Well into her seventies and not recently in the best of health, Ms. Horn is a national treasure for jazz lovers. While she barely sings above a whisper, her emotion,timing and phrasing are on par with Sinatra--heady company indeed. This album showcases her vocal and piano skills in a golden light.Combined with the lush overlay of Johnny Mandel's beautiful string arrangements, this is a truly glorious cd that stays with you. Rarely have I seen a CD described on Amazon in such universally passionate and glorious terms."
1,Tragic fall of a family,"Bernice Rubens' novels are difficult to find here in America but are definitely worth reading.The Elected Member is about the Zweck family, a well-to-do Orthodox Jewish family in England, and how it slowly disintegrated because of their firm hold onto their culture. The novel centers on the eldest son Norman who once was a top lawyer, but had to be admitted to a mental instituion after suffering a nervous breakdown. But what causes his breakdown? Was it his parents who simply hold onto him too tightly? His 2 sisters whom he committed crimes of the heart against? Rubens expertly transport us to the Zwecks' family past and slowly reveals how past mistakes can come back to haunt everyone in a family."
0,book was destroyed.,"content is great! the company that sent it to me, however, did not mention that the book would come in two parts!! I was horribly dissapointed. I am however, a Social Studies Teacher and I use this book ALL the time in my discussion of Pre-conquest Americas."
1,The funniest movie about the 60s ever,". . . and it comes from France! Set around a funeral, a family gathered - perhaps for the very last time - in grief, and in the midst of a near-revolution, The May Fools manages to cover the entire history of the 60s through hope, euphoria, and paranoia, back to a cynical, sad reality. Still one of the funniest movies ever made.I am fortunate to have an old video tape of it. I am writing this in the hope that someday it will be released on DVD for American audiences."
1,Review of JULIA,DVD arrived quickly and safely - good srvice would use these folk again. No problems encountered.First saw this film in the early 70's at a seaside picture plcae on the East Coast of England (Bridlington). Was charmed by thew story and the actors... Loved the moody scenery... The DVD reflected the original perfectly and was most enjoyable...
0,"Good, but only to the midway point","This is a wonderful Victorian-style novel about a manor house, its mistress, and her domestics. Wonderful that is, until the middle of the story. The author makes choices that effectively shut down the flow and pacing of the story. It's spooky and interesting, but the sudden turn and the unexpected switch in the narrator's point of view, time, and setting make the rest of a great read a downer."
0,too much julie not enough julia,"The politics gets really old really fast as do the day to day lives of the self absorbed and rather dull cast of characters. I really wanted to like the book, but, like a number of other reviewers, I could only make it part way through. PS. enough with the F-word already. It may be hip, but it's jarring especailly when used incessently."
0,Did not live up to expectations,"Getting the book, I thought it 'would change my life' through all the insight Sennett would bestow on me. Sadly not the case, it was a lackluster title. I don't really have any suggestions as to what might be better."
0,It's OKAY,"There's a lot of hype about this being classic literature, and one of the best genre books ever. I disagree. Although Ray Bradbury is a superb writer, this book seems to fall short. The writing is overly poetic, and the dialogue is clunky. If you read this you may find yourself re-reading sentences to figure out what the hell was being said. Although not from the book, there are many, too many, sentences like this:""Will ran, didn't run. Jumped, didn't jump. He stomped his feet on elephant shadows and cat whisker winds.""Again, this isn't an actual sentence from the book, but something similar to the type of writing.Buy it, read it, experience it. These reveiws are just a matter of taste anyway. The book simply left me"
0,"DO Not Buy, Do Not Buy","I read a lot of negative reviews about the purchase of high end, expensive perfumes at Amazon Website; however, since this one was being sold by amazon.com itself, I decided to take a risk. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. The fragrance is so subtle that even a person standing one foot away cannot appreciate it------------and that is immediately after putting it on! Complete waste of money."
1,An epic like no other,"I worked for the most well-known entertainment company in the world, so I'm very familiar with the ""formula"" used in epics such as ""Gladiator."" Yet even with the knowledge of how it would follow the peaks and valleys of a pre-determined storyline, it was still an amazing movie. I watched it 3 times in the first week of its release (in the theaters) and I bought several copies of the DVD for family and friends. Watch this movie uninterrupted, without distraction, and on the biggest screen you can access. Among the best movies of all time..."
1,Ladies & Gentlemen...it's The Rolling Stones!,"I'm not the most analytical reviewer out there for some of you who want a ""well-reasoned"", ""logically-based"", ""original"", ""thought-provoking"" review. I simply like what I hear or I don't. But I love music and certain bands I have loved for 40 years. The Rolling Stones is one of them. I picked up the CD simply because it was the Rolling Stones. I listened to it and from the first it sounded just EXCELLENT. They kept to the formula and then spiked it! I'm not going to compare it to past albums, or group line-ups or anything. I cannot tell you if it is better or worse than other albums. This one just stands on it's own! If you do love the Rolling Stones, you will be floored! Let me just tell you that in their golden years, the Stones still had the ""stones"" to pull it off again. You pick this CD up for the heck of it, and you walk away 100% satisfied that you got your money's worth, and unlike Mick, YOU GET SATISFACTION! What a superb rocker!"
0,Bug Zapper,I was hoping for something with more power to actually zap the bugs but this one does not. I even purchased two sets. The light does cause the bugs to swarm around it but it does not have enough power to actually kill the bugs.When it is on the light setting it isn't enough light to even guide you along a path. I am very disappointed in it.We will be purchasing an electric bug zapper soon to replace these.
1,Greatest of all times.,"Of course everyone knows that this album is a masterpiece. It's Lauyrn's greatest work. Regardless what people say about Lauryn Hill she is remarkable. She's like no other human being ya know. I love the Miseducation of Lauyrn Hill, this is my 5 time buying the cd, the first 2 times someone stole it from me and the other 2, I wore the cds out listening to them so much."
1,great,"These are authentic Ray-Ban aviator glasses and they look amazing on an average person's face even though they say they are large. the only thing i don't like it that the lens aren't a non-see through green, depending on the lighting, people can see your eyes, this happens about % of the time. outside of that they are amazing glasses and look great."
1,Enthralling,"My son and I started reading parts of this in the car on a trip. We are both aficionados of anything mythological, and encountering these profound, rich, and unusual stories has been inspiring to both of us (but probably most inspiring to my son). The stories we have read so far are presented both as myths, but also as possibilities, expanding the idea of what might have been and what might be, offering also a window of insight into the times in which the myths were captured. The myths are largely framed within the context of the Christian and Roman Catholic Church and culture, and do reveal some of the bias of the times against the Jews and Judaic faith. While not politically correct, this is a solid well-written work with much education potential, if placed in context and not read as a sole work on the topic. One of the best free books I've gotten for the Kindle!"
0,Difficult Read,"This story is one of the most difficult stories I have read thus far. I am supposed to summarize the story for an English Majors course; but because the sentences are so long and tangled, I keep losing track of which character is being talked about. I have read and reread the story, but still have difficulty summarizing the story. The excruciatingly long paragraphs are what makes it so difficult to follow. Use caution when reading this story."

0,Rod adds nothing to these classic tunes,"As someone else wrote in review, Rod sounds like he's singing to a karaoke track. The backing instrumental tracks in most cases, especially Have You Ever Seen The Rain sound like they were created by turning a tape recorder on and copying directly from the original song. Boring. Also on Day After Day, Rod's drummer uses identical fills at the identical spots Badfinger's drummer's played his. The album is very uninspired. However,it was clever of him to record It's A Heartache because most people compared Bonnie Tyler to Stewart when she released that tune yrs ago. This is the 1st Rod album I've bought since Sing It Again Rod and this is not even close to the quality of that release. As most people said, Rod has enough money. If he won't write or perform any new original material anymore, he should think about packing it in. He's had a nice run."
1,Comfort Fit Here.,"I bought these Dickies work pants , we used to call them ""chinos"" in the 1950s,don't ask me why.Ok so they are comfortable and light to wear not heavy canvas pants which is what ""bluejeans"" really. You walk around in heavy canvas pants or dungarees and wonder why your legs get tired so easy! DA! Anyway I woke up and now I will wear light workpants like Dickies and relax. I do recommend these to anyone ."
0,Don't bother!,"I love this group's early feel-good canadian rock n' roll, but I stumbled onto this album in a music store in the mall. With excitement, I sampled all the songs and to my disappointment, I still can't figure out what the hit was suppose to be. It's really terrible so don't bother. Just stick to their old stuff. Their 80's stuff rocks!!"
1,Unique Weird Orientalia from the 1930's,"Exotic tales of the Orient from the 1930's. ""Dr Shen Fu"", a Weird Tales magazine reprint, is about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a price. If you're tired of modern authors who all sound alike, this is the antidote for you. Owen's palette is loaded with splashes of Chinese and Japanese colours. Marvelous."
1,Old protest music by an old hippy. Definitely not country music.,"This is a compilation of songs published on other records. It is still good. Writing a protest song was and is just Country Joe McDonald’s way of saying hello. If you are interested in the 60s or the Vietnam War this is worth considering. The most known song on this album, The Fixing to Die Rag, is less raucous than the Woodstock version of that song and still a good version, with the advantage that I can play this one for the grand kiddies without their grandmother going ballistic. For a long time this album was only available at great cost but now it has been republished at a reasonable price and is worth considering."
1,Mest is WICKED,"Mest takes every genre and mixes it together. They have the pop punk edge, of course, over thuggish R&B;/Rap beats, and they have some raggae and ballads mixed in there as well. This is teenage angst, with the humor of the Beastie Boys, and the angst of Good Charlotte.They're really eclectic, and not too hard on the eyes either. :)"
0,Poorly Done!,"Fist of that version of the national anthem was the pitts!I mean all of those train and carrying on was ridiculous! First off no one will and ever sing the National Anthem like Whitney Houston! Beyonce did an alright job! People are making that up to be something its not!Thank You for your time and consideration!!Sincerly Yours,A Music Major at Florida Stae University!"
1,Another Binchy Great,"This book takes a typical family, examines its seperate members, and then provides a look at the whole with the knowledge of the secrets each member has.I enjoy Binchy's style of writing interconnected stories that weave together. She pulled it off first in Lilac Bus and now Silver Wedding."
1,Lost Balls....Found?,"Nice book, not quite as good as I expected but had some really awesome photos! AC"
0,ewan mcgregor's hot,"although ewan mcgregor is my ultimate favorite actor in the entire world..i have to say that this was a terrible movie. and yes..sadly, ewan co-produced it! <i don't why he would ever sign to be co-producer of THAT film..it should have been moulin rouge!> So back to the movie..I hated Susan Lynch in this film. has she ever heard of shaving? I know this is back in the day so I'll give her that much. But she was a little TOO hairy for me. This movie is really graphic and it shows a lot of uh..stuff. Ewan was so cute in it! But I think there could have been a better Nora picked. This is definitlely an erotic film like the actual overview says. the reason why i gave this film only 1 star is because it was so hard to follow! i figured out in the middle that time was jumping VERY fast. they should have dates as subtitles. It jumped ahead quickly, it was too graphic, and overall..it's probably one of the worst films i have ever seen. sorry ewan!!!"

1,justice league done right finally,smallville is a very unique take on the legendary man of steel. but it is pretty much the same when it comes to using the two most popular icons in dc comics. use superman and batman to promote other dc comics charactors but in this show it works to a point. all i would say is that these last seasons of smallville have gotten justice league right and justice league was done right in thses last seasons of smallville. It is a shame that the animated series that calls itself justice league was not more like this. This show gets it right the way justice league should have been.
0,Not Very good,"I dont advise buying this grider, it broken when i pressed it. the plastic is very fragile and dont support the pressure requered for grinding the pepper."
1,Great science videos.,"My children love these videos. Although they are just 7 and 9 years old, they learn something everytime they watch any of them - and so do I! These videos have a great way of presenting the amazing wonders of nature and God's handywork all around us. We purchased the 19 DVD setMoody Science Classics: 19-DVD Set, and it was well worth it!!!"
1,Legend or the truth?,"The Hound of the Baskervilles is a true mystery classic by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It tells of Sherlock Holmes and his trusty comrade, Dr. John Watson. This extraordinary pair has solved dozens of mysteries times before, but now come to their most difficult case. Years ago, Hugo Baskerville was killed by a monstrous hound. This curse of the hound has haunted all the Baskervilles who come to live at the Baskerville Hall. Sir Charles goes to live there, but soon is found dead, scared to death. His only relative, Sir Henry Baskerville, goes to live at Baskerville Hall accompanied by Holmes and Watson. All along the way, they are left mysterious clues that eventually help them unlock the killer. I really liked this classic who-dun-it because around every corner was a twist. It kept you guessing until the end and was really upbeat."
0,worst dress shirts thin cloth and not professional at all,"I didnt knew that amazon had such a poor quality control and also they dont have any control over other vendors, Save $8 by not buying this product ...Very thin and very large sized shirts .... they are see thru and look no where like they are shown on web site ..."
1,Good CD dictionary that can be better,"This review is for CD version. I agree with most of previous reviewers that this is top notch American English dictionary.Some previous reviewers complained that the new words are not inserted into the main body of the dictionary. This could be a problem for the printed version. For CD version, this is not a problem. When looking up a word, I cannot tell if it is from the original or from the new word list.I do not understnad why the multimedia function is not on the CD. If it uses too much hard disk space, it can be made available from CD, as Random House did. No pronouncing symbols can compare with the real sound."
1,shock to the system,"Upon hearing the song Toxicity on MTV I had absolutely no hesitation in buying this album knowing that it would contain at least one gem. What I didn't expect was such consistency.Initially tracks like X and Forest do not stand out as much as MTV hits Chop Suey! and Toxicity, however on further listens you will discover that it is the lesser known tracks that hold your interest and ensure this album stays in your cd player for a while. I now hope to see these guys live at some stage to see if the energy displayed on this album translates as well in live performance."
1,My nephew loved this!,I gave it all 5 stars just because my nephew loved it so much. He is very hard to please at 9 yrs old and this was something he really enjoyed. He likes hands on things and race cars so there you go.
1,Perversely Uplifting,"I am trying to be frugal with my five star reviews but this album deserves full marks without question. Judging by my screen name, one can safely assume that I am a Will Oldham fan. I, myself not being much of a writer, will avoid trying to pin this album down with my words but direct those interested to reviews at both pitchforkmedia.com and nme.com."
0,Poorest war movie ever made,"'Midway' on DVD while we're still waiting for 'The Longest Day'- somebody's got to be kidding. This one really sucks. Here we go: stock-shots ripped off from 'Thirty seconds over Tokyo', 'Tora Tora Tora' and probably other movies, WWII newsreels footage extensively cropped to fit into the Panavision frame, meaningless cameos by various aging stars -probably to make the flick look like a blockbuster- , historical mistakes and countless errors about planes and aircraft carriers, inept dramatization -the predictable romance between Heston's son and a Japanese girl-, you name it. The only reason I give this awful turkey one star is because the software doesn't allow me to give it none."
0,Tear Up the Formula,"I am a fan of Mr Patterson's books, but this one was very disapointing. It was like he sat down and wrote up a list of ""what will make women cry"" and then put every single thing in the book. It is overdone to the point of you can not connect to the characters because the tragedy's that happen to them are too much and in a manner that is not realistic to everyday life. Mr Patterson needed to think instead of what will make a woman cry but what will make a good story not a formulated story. This book tried to force the reader to be emotional and instead makes you feel annoyed at the characters and the story."
1,"Its better then a ""normal"" bed","I just moved out of my moms house and I did'nt want to bring my huge bed/dressar with me so I got the airbed. Its been 2 months since I moved out and I'm still sleeping on it. You can have it fully inflated for a very firm bed or deflate it for a softer bed. I like mine halfway deflated, its like sleeping on a cloud."
1,"National Geographic ""Africa"" Series","Beautifully photographed. However, if you're interested in Africa from a political and historical standpoint, as I am, this is not really the video series for you.Excellent wildlife and nature footage (just as you'd expect from National Geographic) and even an attempt to convey some sociological lessons about ""urban"" vs. ""tribal"" differences.Overall, well worth watching, but don't look to it for very deep historical or political enlightenment about the continent."
0,not what you think,"First off this helmet is enormous, even in a medium. It is the right size for my head and fits ok but I might as well flip it upside down because is sits on the top of my head and doesn't really go on or around it. There is so much padding inside it that it does not even slide halfway down your head. Obviously a knock off with the materials used. I don't understand why there are so many good reviews! The chrome looks nice but it's so easily corrupted that I scratched it with my fingernails trying to get the stickers off of it. I can understand that in order for it to be DOT approved that it should include a lot of padding but the only way this helmet would be safe is if you fell straight down from the sky onto your head. I am definitely returning this helmet despite having to pay for shipping both ways. I will up my rating review if the refund goes smoothly."
0,It was a great finish nailer unitl it broke.,I bought the nailer over a year ago and use it every few weeks when I get some finish work. It is light weight and it is easy to clear jams. One day it would not fire. I took it to be rebuilt and had an estimate of $100. The guy called and told me it needs a new firing mechanism and it would cost $189. So I am ordering the Hitachi today.
1,hard -to-find tension rods,"Our living room has a ""bow"" window with five narrow panels. I looked many places for narrow-but-strong tension rods. I was pleased to find these and to get free shipping. I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you."
1,What is this gorgeous chaos ?,Just buy this album. 'Dry the rain' is the best song ever. 'Dog's got a bone' is close to being the best ballad ever. Each song is as original and unexpected as an earthquake. Push it out. Feel the Beta vibe.
1,hilarious,This movie is hilarious!!!!!!!! I saw it with my friend and we laughed throughout the entire thing.
0,Worst movie in history,Where to start? This thing is so bad that it is a disgrace to bad melodrama. The plot is so predictable it is sickening. This movie wasn't even released until after Harry Potter was released.
0,Not a true CD Audio or DVD Audio Disc,I'm a big bjork fan - I'm also a big fan of the higher fidelity DVD Audio format and remastered CD sound (although some remasters are atrocious) - so I thought this disc was a great buy.However I wasn't pleased to find that the CD Audio side won't play in the car or on the computer as it's not recognized as a CD Audio disc (apparently not uncommon with Dual Discs) - just as frustrating is the lack of true DVD-Audio using MLP (Meridian Lossless) which is superior to the Dolby and DTS surround sound provided here. Interestingly my computer was happy to read the DVD side but reports the surround sound as 48/24 for both Dolby and DTS not the 96/24 claimed. If you are looking for the superior audio you thought this disc offered - then you'll need to be happy playing it on your DVD player only. Disappointing. I already own the videos on DVD - so I haven't taken that into consideration in this review.
0,same problems as munchkin version,"Ditto to other complaints - won't separate easily- either by unscrewing or prizing. Cheap, flimsy, leaks water also because no gasket. I'm looking for something else and hoping reviewers will give honest good advice . . . this almost identical to product by Munchkin"
1,Never becomes passe!,"I decided to read this book after watching it on PBS. Of course there was more detail in the actual novel and Jane Austen never fails to ""dazzle you with her footwork"". The description and narrative is beautiful and makes you feels as if you were actually there."
0,"A decent album, I've heard a lot better though...","Although I'll admit this CD has its charms, I firmly believe that it should not garner a five star rating. The detriments to this album include the following: first, the album is full of Lauryn Hill speaking inane lyrics that faintly resemble some sort of electronica instrument; second, the songs lack differentiation (as in they are mostly the same beat.); and finally, the bitter lyrics really give me a headache. (Disregard the rambling run-on sentances.)"
1,Barbara Crampton looks great in leather!,Great horror movie! Jeffrey Combs does very well in this one
0,delta sigma book,"Hi,I bought this book sometime last month. Received it couple of weeks back. It was delivered promptly, but the book print quality seems to be bad. In fact it looks like a fake! Looks more like a photocopy of the original book. So much for paying this kind of money to buy the 'original'."
1,Great space heater!,"It swivels, has a remote and a tipover safety feature, and you can mount it on the wall if you desire. It works wonderfully, providing plenty of heat when you need it."
1,Crystal clear production and interesting arrangements.,"I really like this album and I think the intent of the musician is somewhat more involved than the lyrics would have you believe. I think he is railing against the church and how it has distorted and destroyed whatever purity there was about the early Christian movement.Musically, the horror film samples work well next to the distorted vocals. The synths sound fantastic and the percussion has a nice amount of grainy distortion added so that the tracks are rarely boring, if at all - they pound, scream and soar through the average sonic boundary.I agree with Virus mag's review in that this album is not the most original thing out there, but the concept of the album is interesting and keeps it all pieced together. There's nothing bad about this album per se, but nothing really grabs my attention as being too exciting in terms of originality.Nevertheless, a good album for fans of dark electro/industrial/terror EBM."
1,One of my favorites...,"...with two of my favorite actors: Mark Harmon and the lovely Madeline Stowe.I caught this on cable back in the early 90's. I had a big crush on Madeline Stowe, since seeing her in ""Revenge"". So I decided to check this out...and I was not disappointed.Definitely not a general classic, but I love this film. With less-capable and less-likeable actors, this film would (...). This is one of those rare cases where the actors elevate the material.This is one of those rainy-day, ""got-nothing-else-to-do"" movies.It's definitely worth a look, and the Amazon price is definitely right. Give it a shot. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
1,A movie that as it all!,"Before I first watched ""I, Robot"" I was afraid it might have sold out as an action film. Thankfully I was wrong.""I, Robot"" contained an even balance of not only action, but psychology, sociolgy, philosophy, the clash of logic and emotions, life, and unconditional love. The movie made you think and feel with its knowledge, although its visuals and sounds were equally appealing with another nice balance of the present and the movie's version of the future. Such a natural feeling is rare in action films which helped the mind to agree that it is believable.If you watch this movie watch it not only for its action, but its beautiful philosophies. It can make anyone think. Or if you don't like to think, enjoy the action and seeing Will Smith naked in the shower (unless you don't swing that way). ;)"
0,"Really Poor Product, maybe it was just mine","The reviews were great on this products, that is why I bought it.But when received mine in the mail and tried it out, It was completely useless, I think the worst 10 Dollars I have ever spent.It would not grip any hair of mine, the quality felt very poor, I had better experiences with tweezers from Walmart.Really disappointed."
1,The Best Debut CD EVER!,"This band is amazing. Like everybody else, the first song I ever heard was Absolutely (story of a girl), and I bought the CD because that song was great. But the rest of the CD is even better. ""If I Am,"" ""Sometimes,"" ""Crazy,"" and all the other songs on the CD are gorgeous. They shouldn't be compared to other five person bands like Matchbox 20 or Vertical Horizon because they blow the hell out of those bands. Nine Days are five truly gifted musicians who deserve to go platinum one million times over. Everyone should by this CD because I guarantee there is not one track on it that will disappoint you. Nine Days is a breath of fresh air in the music world and should not be missed. Buy this CD!"
1,Great tune!,"The Prodigy are back!""Baby's Got A Temper"" is a fantastic record - just whatwe need right now in an age where all the music industryhas to offer is endless, dire amounts of pop-garbage.The only bad thing I have to say about this great CD isthat the other mixes don't vary too much from the originaltrack, being a dub and instrumental (respectively). I wouldhave preferred a couple of new tracks.That said, ""Baby's Got A Temper"" is such a great,catchy song, that I still enjoy the other versions and Ijust can't get enough of the tune itself anyway!:) Great video too!!Absolutely recommended!"
1,A classic!,"Of all the albums we bought in the 70s this is one of my favorites! When I get in the mood for reggae I usually start here with 'Let my days be long' (or 'Revolution' on Marley's 'Natty Dread'). It is 'religious', as others have mentioned, but that shouldn't be a problem if you appreciate different styles(?) of reggae. Did I forget to mention 'Super Ape' or Augustus Pablo? Man."
1,Interesting View Into British Culture,As one would expect these producrions are beautifully presented. The quality of the acting is superb. England seems to produce character actors of great skill and presence. I thoroughly enjoyed the variety of themes presented
0,Didn't like the paper quality and presentation,"I bought them (all the Barnes & Noble Classics) to complete my Jane Austen's collection, and honestly, didn't like the paper quality, it seems like they didn't even care for the presentation of them; it didn't look elegant, cheap to be more specific."
1,Works Great,"Most Panasonic cameras have a pretty good battery life. Unless you shoot a lot of pictures, or use the flash a lot. In that case, you will need another battery and this is a good choice."
