1,Good but litle expensive,It is very good but it is becoming little expoensive at amazon as compared to other brands available at stores like costco.
1,I think you're missing the point.,"I think a couple of people are missing the point... The reason this is out is (I heard) they didn't have the cash to finish AV Vol 2, so this would generate some cash AND be of interest to their core fans. Plus, the demos ~are~ a good insight to their creative process.... I ~love~ to see the rough drafts... If you're just waiting for Vol 2, why did you buy this in the first place?"
1,Looking forward to reading other books by this author,This book was so fascinating that I could not take a break from reading it. I look forward to reading Dr. Han's books The Secret Life of Quanta and The Probably Universe.
1,Too firm for me,"I bought this for a lot more money at the Relax The Back store. Amazon has a much better price. I like the design of it but it has some flaws. The pillow case is hard to get onto the pillow and stretches taught right where I'd like to rest my head making it a bit uncomfortable. Also the lower ""legs"" of the product are much too firm to have between my knees. It raises my leg up too high and hurts my hip. I'm 5'7"" so this isn't a problem of being too petite. A flat spot has formed within a few days where I have to lift it open to get in and out of bed. I still like it and haven't found anything comparable."
0,The angel slipped,This is a light weight film with a heavy weight star. The film is not worthy of the great Paul Muni.
1,Michael J Fox shines....,"This is Michael J Fox's at his best. The movie is very good. I can watch this one over and over. Good cast, except Sean Penn overacts his character. Definitely worth viewing."
1,good but not perfect,"It is very good for kid more than 1 month . Only one thing i want to say when my baby used it at 1 month ,she grew some rash, but not very serious . So i appreciate pamper all the same . Thanks for supplying quality goods to us."
0,Digital Copy expired,Annoying when you buy a movie mostly because of the digital copy and it has expired months before.This is a major DISAPPOINTMENT!!
0,Not a 'SPORTS' walkman,This product is not typical of Sony quality. I can't believe that Sony can sell this product with a straight face. The problem is when you drop this walkman while running or excercising the batteries fly out and you lose all your preset stations. The clasp that holds the batteries in the radio is flimsy and not designed to sustain an average drop. The old Sony design use to have a heavy duty screw that locked the batteries in the walkman and you can drop it all day long without your batteries flying all over the place and losing your preset stations.Why did Sony re-design something that was already great ? There are many better Sports Walkmans out there. Don't buy this one.
0,Writer and director witoout souls,I cannot imagine a writer and director so soulless that they could read The Haunting of Hill House and come up with this drek. De Bont should go back to directing thrillers like Speed and Self should stick to comic books.
1,Fantastic!,This story is epic. Asimov shines in The Foundation. Makes you want to read the whole series. (something Im in the process of doing now. ;)
0,"Run Away, Run","Although ""Run, Lola, Run"" is off-beat, has some nice camera work and a few impressive images, I could not develop any interest in any of the characters. Lola's extreme red hair and goofy outfit (blue tank top, white bra straps, turquoise pants, and black Doc Martin boots of all things) were distracting. The ""driving music beat"" (or however it was described), was fairly boring and repetitive.The commentary was only slightly more interesting than the movie. The two participants of writer/director Tom and lead actress Franka were a couple at the time, which accounts for the mutual admiration society feel of the commentary.There may have been a good idea for a movie here, but I could not find it. Close to being the least watchable movie (""Lost and Delirious"", ""The Smokers"", ""Black and White"" and ""Armageddon""). I nearly dozed off both times.I give the movie two stars for effort and concept, but I advise you to...""Run Away, Run"""
0,Not worthy,"I'll admit it: I'm a Spongebob junkie. I've seen almost all of the episodes, multiple times. I saw this movie when it came out in theatres with a fellow Spongebob freak. Gosh, we were like 15 and we did not even care.That being said, I did not care for this movie. The writers make great 12-minute episodes, but apparently nothing good comes from trying to make longer plots. It also has some disturbing parts for younger kids, so I don't even let my niece watch it when it comes on TV. She's a big fan of the episodes as well.All in all, stick with the original shows."
1,Loved it!,"Brought back so many wonderful memories of Christmas past!! Wonderful music and singing, top notch! Children love this, and so do grown-ups!! ""This is my box, this is my box, I never travel without my box."" :)"
0,"Paris, Wyoming","First off, my copy, Hudson House Publishers is a subsidy and self-publishing company. In old terminology, ""Vantage Press"" publishing. James paid to publish his novel. PARIS, WYOMING came as a gift as I generally do not purchase subsidy or self-published books or novels. Most do not exert ""tight"" editing and consist of numerous passive voice verbs and common writing errors. Secondly, I will finish this novel as my ""thank you"" to the one giving this gift. To complete reading PARIS, WYOMING, Wyoming will take forever. Lastly, whatever is the ""Wyoming Writers, Inc. 'New Horizons Award'"" as Jim James is a recipient?"
0,Simply awful,"I know its very hard to bring a book like Moby-Dick to the screen, but at least John Houston tried in the 1950's. This made-for-TV adaptation makes me wonder if the screenwriters and director even read the original book. Not only is the character of Queegueg depicted incorrectly as a Mauri of New Zealand (in reality Melville based the character on the Nuku-Hivans), but he is treated as a buffoonish and stereotypical ""savage"" which is completely at odds with the dignified character that Melville created. Additionally, the filmmakers dreamt up a bizarre scene where the Pequod is stranded in the ice of the Antarctic! They must have been reading Mary Shelly's Frankenstien at the time. Patrick Stewart's performance as Ahab however, is wonderful, but that's the only redeeming feature of this overblown mess."
0,Worst toy ever,"Let me count the ways that this is a horrible toy:If you put an egg in the carton wrong end down it can get VERY stuck and what kid knows to put the skinny end down?The case is flimsy plastic.The carton says 18 months+ but it is a choking hazard for kids under 3...hmmm.The ""quote"" on the side is supposedly by a 2 year old - ""With the Egg-Shape Sorter learning my shapes was over easy!"" - what 2 year old says that!!"
0,The cream does not relieve the itch,"You guys are supposed to be reviewing the cream here, not the spray. And as far as I can tell, this cream does NOT relieve the itch at all! Totally ineffective, and I can't really even tell that there's any menthol in it."
1,One of the most scariest movies I have ever seen!,"This movie has got to been one of the best horror movies I have seen in years. This movie made me so scared, when we saw it in the movie theater, I screamed out ""Oh, my god!"" at one scene of the movie! This movie is a thriller."
1,glider,"the glider got here much sooner than I thought, it arrived in great shape and all the pieces were there. I put it together by myself even if the kept saying 2 people. It was not hard and directions were simple.. It's really nice"
1,The Descent,"This movie was really great, I wasn't expecting much, but this movie has more blood than any horror movie I've seen so far. Good story, very scary at times, and I don't scare easily, enjoyed this movie very much."
0,A somewhat annoying companion,"This book may be of value to someone who really knows Virgil and Virgilian scholarship, but Horsfall's style is so idiosyncratic, and his approach so random, that students and other intermediate readers are best warned off. Ideas are presented, or hinted at, in sentences or sentence fragments overflowing with parentheses, exclamation points, question marks, footnotes, and cross-references. The text is poorly edited and in places doesn't make any sense at all. Overall, one gets the impression that Horsfall (who wrote most of the book, and translated two chapters from Italian into his own idiom) is a brilliant scholar who welcomes us into his brain but really can't be bothered tidying up before we come in."
0,Dumb and unsatisfying.,"Dumb and unsatisfying horror movie that is made worse by the terrible acting of Keanu Reeves, who is extremely miscast in his role. The rest of the film is almost as bad as Reeves's performance with the exception of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a great performance thou out despite the movie horrible script and crappy special effects. I would have paid to see her character in a more serious and better horror film than the garbage that is here.The one star review is for Weisz, for at least giving a great performance despite the huge shortcomings of this film. Too bad that she was not the lead instead of Keanu Reeves."
1,Awsome ..,This is an amazing set of blocks. My 2 yr. old absolutely loves them and these magnetic blocks are very easy to use. Its a great toy for toddlers and preschoolers. Just add a few of the vehicles to it and you have days of imaginative fun ahead. My kids have not stopped playing with these since we bought them a few weeks ago.
0,"this should be titled ""An introduction to Jakarta projects""","If you are new to JSP/servlet development or want to know more about Struct or Log4J, this might be what you need. But for those who wanted to get in depth detail on Tomcat, forget it."
1,SpongeBob SquarePants Movie = Great Movie For All,"I personally love this movie. I am a fan of the series and I just had to see this movie. So, the very day it came out, I bought it and watched it with my family.And guess what! I loved it! SpongeBob & Patrick go after Neptune's crown in order to save Mr. Krabs from being incenterated by Neptune. While this is going on, Plankton (who is the one who actully stole Neptune's crown and has conquered Bikini Bottom) send a bounty hunter to stop SpongeBob and Patrick from retrieving it from Shell City.All this plus David Hasselhoff and bubble hating tough guys too!And SpongeBob and Patrick have to face monsters and a giant Cyclops (a man in an old fashion diving suit!A great movie with a great voice cast and a great story make this a treat for fans and non-fans alike. So, what are you waiting for? Buy this great DVD and enjoy it again and again."
1,Excellent Rice Cooker,Great product. Perfect rice every time. Excellent for brown rice. Keeps rice warm. Also does excellent job of cooking grits. Easy to clean. Takes a little longer to cook rice but the flavor is worth the wait. Pricey but great quality. Would highly recommend this product.
0,2 Good Songs,"This album was basically horrible the only 2 good songs were the 2 singles ""Tush"" & ""Run"" the rest of the album was trash. I would definitely not recommend this album. All the beats are horrible and the collaborations suck too."
1,Love these tires!,I have purchased 2 other sets of City tires & these are by far the superior ones. They are fast on straights & handle nicely on turns. I will be definitely be purchasing another set of these when my old set is done.
0,SUCKS,this movie was the longest...boring movie i have ever seen. i didn't think he could ever do a horrible movie till this one. the whole movie shows him getting high and going on trips and setting people up for his mistakes...its a bunch of crap! maybe it would be good for someone that is really stoned out of their mind to sit down in watch.
1,Very pretty and good quality,My two year absolutely loves puzzles and this has been a great addition to our collection.. It's sturdy and I don't think she'll be able to wear it out or break it.
1,Awesome,This is the book that got me buying the other two in the series. I got it through the lending library on my kindle fire. I love the books that just appeal to me. Its much better than watching a movie.
1,Great Show!,Arrived safe and sound and in a timely manner. Nice addition to my ever-growing classic movie library!
1,Good For the 'New ' No Limit,"C-Murder is obviously Master P's little brother. With a similar delivery and all most identical voice, he finally has begun his approach out of his big bro's shadow. Kinda sad to see some of the faces gone after No Limit has revamped(biggest manuever NO Beats by the Pound), but their new musical style is gonna keep them in CD players all over the streets. This album has a handful of 'gems'. I personally like the songs Damned If They Murder Me, Down for my N!gg@s, and Hustlin. Gotta love Krazy(2Pac's vocal clone) and Mac brings it every time. C-Murder keeps up with the basic formula for song concepts that has made No Limit famous. If your a No Limit fan you've already got the album. If your not, this is a quality album but definately peep a few more albums off the label to fully appreciate how far they have come. Keep your CD's spinning."
0,Why Did They Choose HER?!,"I saw this movie on television. I was really excited because I thought it would be interesting and Audrey Hepburn is one of my favorite actresses. Well...This movie was AWFUL!! Why on earth would they pick Jennifer Hewitt to play Audrey Hepburn. Natile Portman might have been a better choice. As others said, the girl who played the younger Audrey did a pretty good job. Perhaps Miss Hewitt is a better actress in other shows and movies, but not this time. This movie could almost be classified as a comedy! She didn't even keep up her fake Audrey voice throughout the entire movie,and when she did use it she sounded like Audrey with one word 'CAT'.The actors who played Gregory Peck and William Holden were a joke; they were awful and didn't look or sound like either Peck or Holden. The movie showed none of Audrey's later life. If you missed seeing this on television,you didn't miss much. If you still want to see this, rent it; you might be sorry if you buy it first."
1,Tivo is much better than your cable company's DVR,"Tivo is a great service and well worth the extra costs compared to the cable or satellite company DVR. It works well, is reliable, and will truly change the way you watch tv. The downside to all this is that most Tivo boxes (except for the expensive Series3) all rely on analog cable connections. This will be a problem in the future, as cable companies move away from analog systems and to digital systems. (Of course, there are work-arounds, but they aren't very elegant or cost effective). As long as you know this limitation, and that the future of the Tivo Series2 is limited - it's the best thing since sliced bread and well worth every penny!"
1,50 First Dates,"Adam Sandler plays a guy that is about to giveup on love until he meets Drew Barrymore whohas a short-term memory loss, where she forgetseverything the next day; she can only rememberanything that has happened before the tragicmoment in her life that messed up her brain."
0,only about custody!,"This book should be titled 'What Every Woman Should Know about Custody Battles'. I found absolutely nothing helpful about a basic childless divorce in this book. If you are going through a divorce and have custody issues, this might be okay for you. If you have no children, don't even bother."
0,horrible,"This [guy] can't sing. The music is nu metal [crap]....with no talent. If you like this, you are under 18 years old. Otherwise, shame on you. This [garbage] deserves zero stars. Are these guys terrorists?"
0,A Bore,"I watched this movie when it first came out and thought it was really boring and disappointing. I generally like Katie Holmes and think she was fine in the movie, but Christian Bale was lousy and so was the plot and direction of this movie. If you just want to see a series of technical movie stunts followed by a few mildly romantic scenes surrounding a plethora of neurotic, self-absorbed dialogue, psychosis, and horrible directing, then you might be interested in watching this movie."
0,Not a fan.,A mediocre story plagued by poor writing. The ending is too obvious. The gypsy game is a redundant plot element - the same effect is achieved by the fact that the boys are twins. The author seems to take the easy way out: he neither assumes a POV nor does the plot justify the unnanounced changes in POV.*SPOILER* The only enjoyable part of the novel I found was the final scene. At least the demise of the infant was inventive.
1,Big O,The shrink wrap was still on the CD needless to say I was impressed this is the very definition of new 5 stars for sure
1,Beautiful,This movie is just brillant! Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are fabulous. and Liv Tyler sparkles. Plunkett and Macleane had all elements of a memorable movie that you'll want to watch again and again!
0,The music's better than the movie,"SPINOUT is another hard movie to sit through, thanks to the weak dialogue and even weaker storyline.Elvis plays a singing race car driver (for the second time), who is being chased by three women. These include a spoiled brat (Shelley Fabares), an erotic author (Diane McBain), and his own drummer (Deborah Walley).The music is actually listenable in this picture. Highlights include ""Stop, Look, and Listen"" and ""I'll Be Back"".Elvis appears to be sleepwalking through this one. His appearance is also disturbing: slightly overweight and his hair looks like a big black ball on his head.Again, not QUITE the worst, but far from the best. Buy something more worthwhile first."
1,Nice compression shirt...runs small...,like the other reviews state order size bigger...trust me I usually wear XL...I'm 6ft 210 broad shoulders so I read the reviews and followed their advice. I ordered an 2XL and this shirt is very tight without being washed yet. SO do order size up.
0,Abysmal,"I was quite disappointed after reading Autumn. Maybe it was the large anticipation I had incorporated when purchasing the book, thinking that post-apocalyptic scenarios were ""my kind of thing"" (and they still are). However, Moody's book was very poorly written. Not only did I encounter numerous grammatical mistakes, but there was absolutely no connection with the characters. It was almost like, ""here are the characters, now you must try and relate to them and follow through with their overly obvious situations."" I felt no sympathy with Carl's death, or any other middle school -written events that occurred. Overall, this was a terrible book in the sense that there was no captivation whatsoever. Although the abysmal stance of Autumn, Moody is an amateur, and will hopefully progress in later writings."
1,in the heart of the sea,"this is one of the finest books i've ever read. the story is fabulous and the author's delivery is perfect. however, it is VERY graphic. the content can be extremely disturbing if you are not interested in the worst events any human can experience. it is told from the perspective of the survivors."
1,love it!,"I love this watch and get compliments on it all the time. I am an RN and have looked for years for a watch that performs all that this one does. Analog face, digital 24 hr clock,and many other features that I will never use. The best feature for me is the count down timer. I knocked off points because 1. there isn't a second hand, the seconds are digital display. 2. I'm concerned about the band because it is getting dirty and reg. soap doesn't clean it. The silver ring around the face really shows it off. Sits high and is a serious sports watch but I'm wearing it at the hospital."
1,ONE OF ALL-TIME FAVORITES!,"This story felt like I was living there...feeling, tasting, sweating, right along with the characters. I would have sworn Gloss was taking this word for word from the woman's diary. Being thrilled by such everyday struggles like getting a mule down the hill..now thats what I call virtual reality. I was so enthralled by the ""cowboys""...kept thinking I never would have dreamed I'de love a book like this so much...but it was so true and delicious. Thanks for taking me to Oregon in the 1890's. It was a thrilling, amazing adventure. The struggle's the pioneers endured were incredible...so much more so for a woman, and a woman alone at that!"
1,okay for the price,"I used it for a week and half and it seem to work as described. I don't know how well its going to work for over a long period of time, but it is cheap so it probably wouldn't last that long. No leakage of air or anything yet. It was the right size for me and I am 5'2, it might be small if your over 6' I'd imagine. Anyways, I recommend it to people who are looking for a temporary place to sleep."
1,Great Book,Started reading and recently finished. It is amazing how Jules Verne can imagine a submarine back in 1870. Makes one wonder how he could capture the essence and adventure of the Sea.
0,A book written by a torture lawyer,There's no way I would read a book and give profit to a man who wrote memos to attempt to allow Bush to circumvent the Geneva Convention against torture.
0,Truly awful!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I read some reviews here and elsewhere that sounded positive, but honestly this film was AWFUL. My friend and I seriously discussed leaving after the first 20 minutes (somthing I have never done before), but decided to stick it out and hope that it would get better. It did, but only marginally. I ended up wishing that I had walked in the first place and not wasted my time and $9.00 on this sea of stupid lines and pointless ""plot"". It was insulting to both Hawaiians and Trans-gender people and most of all was NOT FUNNY, truly. I like Drew Barrymore, and Adam Sandler when he is playing a character with a brain in his head--and there is chemistry between these actors(...). Rent The Wedding Singer instead. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY--if you are over the age of 11 this film is too immature for you. And if you are under the age of 11 you will be bored."
0,"Sucked really bad, not even a rental...","This movie was by far the worst I have ever seen, I had to fast forward most of it, as it was painfully drug out. You would be better off constipated, sitting on the throne with a comic book instead of watching this load of garbage.Eastcoast Phil.TCBRN."
0,Inappropriate for young children,"In two of the episodes, the word ""shut up"" is used. My son is three years old and instantly picked up on it, repeated it, and told me it was a bad word, but that James and Duck (the trains) had said it. I would stay away from this one, especially if you have young, impressionable youngsters. I gave it one star, since the wooden dragon train came with it."
1,This is my absolute favorite Depeche Mode album!,"I first heard Depeche Mode when Violator came out and decided to buy previous albums. This one, by far, is one of the best! 101 is another great album. Strangelove, Little 15, I want you know are all awesome songs! I can hear any Depeche Mode song and go back to my high school years! I was totally in love with David!"
0,"Good, but I expected more","After falling in love with Nathaniel and Elizabeth in Into the Wilderness, I was thrilled to continue on with the series. Much to my dismay, this book did not live up to my expectations. Is it a coincidence that Gabaldon's Voyager and this book, both set mainly upon the high seas, were my least favorite out of each author's series? Hmmm. The only thing that kept me going was the promise of the third book Lake in The Clouds. The book is worth reading, don't get me wrong. Especially for those who continue on with a series. The Scotland thing seemed unnecessary to me. I would have been happier if they'd stayed in North America. Oh well. Artistic license."
1,Very pleased,I love Pampers diapers. The diapers never leak even at nighttime or long road trips with our babies.
1,Great Book,"This wasn't the fastest ship in the world but it was shipped in great condition (which I am sure is difficult for a paper back) I love the book, I have read it several times before, just wanted to add it to my collection."
0,Zorba the Greek,"The quality of the materials was very disappointing, also parts of the orignal book were deleted. This was especially bad because it was for a gift. Further, I will not ever have any item gift wrapped. It was pretty cheesy."
0,Disappointed,"What a shame that these are considered to be"" acclaimed films""..while the color,design,etc was fine-I was. Surprised that these fine actors would choose to act in such features.To be honest,I must admit. That I was unable to bring myself to finish viewing them all,it went from bad to worse"
1,Medicine for the Soul!!,"This film has to be one of the most feel good, charming, and entertaining movies I have ever seen! After a tough day, a bad experience, whatever unpleasantness the world can dish out, ""Moonstruck"" has the ability to make it all better. The film takes you to a place where it is all forgotten, at least for the time spent enjoying it. Cher, always wonderful, will put a smile on your face from the first moment you see her. ""Moonstruck"" is a movie you will want to own! I watch it at least once a month...it's simply the best!!"
1,A Great Book for any Runner,"This book changed the way I run and my outlook on life. I have a more positive attitude and feel more balanced in everything I do. The simple pre-running exercises take very little time and are excellent for running or any stressful activity. Also, I do not consider a run finished without doing my leg raises. I recommend this book for anyone who runs."
0,Not in the same league,This movie just plain ... If you are a fan of the first two you will be sorely disappointed by this installment. It looses its sci/fi roots and edgy humor and just becomes cheesy.
0,the bottom below the false bottom of the barrel,"This movie just barely goes through the motions of all the other movies it's ripping off. Not even fun as trash - it's too dark to see large parts of it. No scares, no suspense, nuthin. Rock bottom."
0,Bummer - also burned,"I read a review of this book at woodworker's gazzette and it was really positive. So I ordered the book and it arrived last week.This book is cursury in its treatment of the topic and has no answers to any of the questions I was interested in. For example there is no discussion of stone tiles, heating systems for tiles, width of groutlines. This book is embarrasing. I have a book from Home-Depot on tiling that is superior to this one in simple answers to simple questions.My advice - avoid this book and look elsewhere for your info."
1,One of the Top Ten for any Gnostic Library,"THE SECRET BOOKS OF THE EGYPTIAN GNOSTICS by Jean Doresse is another great scholarly work free from ""New Age"" claptrap & commercialist distortion. The book is particularly relevant as French author Doresse was literally one of the first Westerners to actually see the original Nag Hammadi texts discovered in 1947. Although Doresse is a Christian proponent with a thinly veiled hostility to Gnostic tradition, he provides a wealth of reference material and, like Kurt Rudolph, indicates a possible interaction with Gnostic beliefs and Paganism--particularly in Alexandria, the motherland of Gnostic Paganism. This book is a MUST READ for any serious student of the origins and practices of Gnostic Philosophy.Gospel of Judas and Other Gnostic Secrets Revealed"
0,Wort. Movie. Ever.,"Transformers 3 is seriously a terrible terrible movie. yeah wow cool, special effects that i have seen time and time again, ridiculously long battle scenes that are so incredibly boring they literally make me fall asleep EVERY time i watch them, Terrible story, terrible plot, terrible rendition of classic characters. Why I even gave this movie a third chance is beyond me."
1,Highly Recommended!,"The best thing about this book is that it quotes extensively and piquantly from the writings and speeches of Jack Welch. The intriguing list of ""29 leadership secrets"" (which could have been reduced to ten) is more selective than secret, given that Welch has been preaching them loudly from a very prominent platform for more than 20 years. However, the book will be valuable to Welch neophytes and to fans who want more Jack, or the essence of Jack. Author Robert Slater assumes a certain familiarity with GE's history and initiatives, and sometimes refers to them without explanation. Welch long ago transcended management to become sort of a leadership prophet, and his utterances are sometimes paradoxical, if not contradictory. He says nurture people, but downsize; he says cut bureaucracy, but implement a paperwork intensive Six Sigma program. We promise that somewhere in here, you'll find a managerial principle to fit almost any occasion. What more can you ask of a handbook?"
1,"""He Lives!""",This was a GREAT book! I typically am not a fan of alternate history (AH) but I could not put this book down what with the plot twists and a great surprise ending.Buy this book!
0,Design confuses some into burning kettle,"I've had one house guest and one nanny place this kettle on my gas stove believing it's a standard kettle. The first time, I wrote Cuisinart a letter, and they graciously sent me a new kettle. Great customer service. The second time, I'm going with a less confusing design, the Capresso glass electric kettle for a couple extra bucks. It's not worth burning my house down ; ).This design looks just like Cusinart's other standard kettles. So if you have elderly parents, or people what are not familiar with recent developments in water boiling, you might want to consider a less confusing design. (p.s. the plastic base melts in seconds if it comes in contact with a heat source)."
1,Dolly Parton - The Grass is Blue,"This is a great CD, especially if you like Bluegrass music and Dolly Parton. What a fantastic combination!"
1,The best series of books out there,"This book is if not the best then it's up there in the top five, along with the other 3 she has written. The story of a young women struggling to grow up and live in a world that doesn't accept her can be related to each of us and will be a book you remember for the rest of your life. The writing is fantastic and you are swept away into a world of prehistoric man that you won't want to come back from. The only problem is when you finish all 4 of her books you are on edge waiting for her to finish the next one. Earth's Children should be the set of books every person has and you will reread it many a time."
0,BIG MESS,"These diapers seem to have gone down hill fast with regards to quality. Over the past two packages (in a span of around 20 diapers) we have had two diapers burst open at night and deposit the inner crystals all over my toddler and his crib. A big mess and who knows the effects of the crystals? Also, my son has NEVER had a diaper rash and now has a severe case. Pampers Baby Dry diapers has been a good value in the past but will never use again."
0,Not good for regular use,"This ball is great when it's inflated, but it doesn't seem to stay that way for long. When I pump it up on a Monday, it's already soft by Tuesday and needs another pump to be usable for anything but bouncing around. I'm pretty disappointed with its performance but waited too long to start using it and therefore am unable to return it..."
1,"""Communion"" movie review","The movie wasn't as scary to watch as it was the first time I saw it two decades ago. But Christopher Walken is so perfectly cast as Whitley Strieber (author of the book and victim of the alien abduction) that I'll keep the DVD as a ""Walken classic!"" He's so unique, and such a hoot. The movie is interesting too."
0,Clay Aiken Who?,"That's right. With music like this he's already forgotten. And to Mr. A music fan from Phila, Pa, Clay Aiken's album was released at a time when there was no other competition. Hello!!! Noone good or really popular anyway is releasing albums at this time, so sure he'll be #1. I'd like to see him go up against Eminem, 50 Cent, Norah Jones, or even Britney will smoke him in sales and she can't even sing. So keep reading , Mr. Music Fan from Philly a.k.a ""Loser"", those same two and only two magazines that like Clay. By the way, my radio stations doesn't play crappy music like yours."
1,Love KidKraft,"I love this desk! In fact, I have two! One for my daughter and one for my son. They are beautiful, flawless and go together easily. They are sturdy and should last a many years. So happy with this purchase!"
1,helps in understanding children,"For a long time I have been discouraged in my efforts to establish two-way communication with children. I would bring books, toys, and games to social functions and share them with children. Once one activity was over, the children would stare at me, waiting for me to start another activity. Why won't they provide any input of their own? Am I overpowering them without realizing it?This book explained everything: the children think I'm a television!"
0,A GREAT IDEA WASTED,"VAn Damme's movies were going nowhere, each one worser than the last one ... Then a good idea came up: why don't try to make a kind of ""epic"" movie, taking a lengendary theme (the French unit called ""Foreigner Legion"" )and changing from the custumary scenario of karate kicks and sterotyphed villains who want to rule the world ? Great idea. I bought it. So, what disapointment after watching this.. it became clear that, no matter how many movies he has already made, Van Damme will never improve as an actor... EVery frame of the movie is wasted, making us think that he is being bad orientated by his agents or film-producers. IT's a totally unconving history, without pace and rhythm..."
0,Mr. Disappointed,"If your looking for an art book with more art similar to the cover, Keith Parkinson, look elsewhere. There is very little sword and magic fantasy contained inside. This book was a major let down. Parkinson's art is maybe the first four to five pages, after that the pages would best be used right before a flush."
1,A Good Fun Guide to Swedish,"I actually purchased this book a few years ago. As a high school student into Swedish culture, I bought this book because it looked fun and easy to read. I was very impressed with this pocket sized text.I felt as though I started learning Swedish right away. I learned my phone number, days of the week and greetings. I taught my friends. They all borrowed the book.I went to Sweden and Finland about a year later. I found it useful. It is not the be all and end all of the Swedish language by any means, but I loved it. I do wish it had an audio tape.I lost the book recently and I have decided to repurchase the same book because I have found none better for the price and quick information it provided."
1,A thing of beauty is a joy forever,"This is an all-new edition, following the 2002 hbk, but Fantagraphics don't flaunt the fact. Why not? The hbk's long sold out and they could sell this all over again to nerds like me. Seriously (OK, I was serious), the hbk's heaven (snap 'em up, fellas, while you can) and this is bliss, apart from the curious (and curiously irritating) typography chosen for the headwords. Trina Robbins went, or was pushed, down the same route when A Century of.. morphed into The Great Women Cartoonists - the Women and the Comics original I've not seen - but we're not talking wacky here, fellas, this is serious art! Well, OK, fun art. Thanks a million, Gary (Groth)"
1,Perfect for my pickup.,I have a S10 pickup with a topper and my options for a bike rack were limited. This is perfect. It's a little labor intensive to put on and take off but it works... it works well... and I'm very happy with it.
1,Even better than 98 if thats possible,"Let me start off by saying that if you are an F1 fan especially a technical one(like myself) you can't pass up this book. If you do not know who Giorgio Piola is, he draws for the weekly magazine AutoSport. He is one of the best artist I have seen. His technical drawings allow you to understand the F1 cars in a technical perspective. Compared to the last edition ""Technical Analysis 98"", this one is even better. If you don't have the 98 book you should order that one too. I do like the 99 book since it is written in english only as opposed to the 98 which is in italian and english, but thats not a problem. What will really impress you is the attention to detail of the drawings, but they are so easy to understand. Again this is a must for any F1 fan. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."

1,astrology,"This a the book everyone should have- from serious students of the stars, to consultants, to people who know nothing at all about astrology. It's brilliant, hilarious, and ORIGINAL. You won't find a lot of this information in any other astrology books and it is accurate-"
0,Greasy Grapefruit!,"A sugar and oil mix with an explosive citrus fragrance. Yes, your skin will feel softer, but it's not worth it. I had to wash it off with soap and water, then clean the tub before I got out so I wouldn't fall. Take a shower and spray yourself with oil spray - it's not messy or stinky, and certainly not as slippery!"
1,Best book ever,This first book in my 62 years that has make me laugh & cry. It is an amazing story of a young women who suffering made her stronger to survive & to love unconditionally.
0,Worst Product which I received from Amazon.,The product which I received was different from other store.It was not soft and comfortable for baby as usual.I don't know why the product was different from the previous ordered one.Worst product that I've ever received.
0,Be aware of ATI products,"I agree with others opinion that if you get lucky and the card installs properly this product is great. I have quite extensive experience with PCs (I have put together over 100 of them) and it took me 6 hours to make this card work. I would give it more stars but..... First of all, when I bought it, it said on a box that FREE VideoStudio 6.0 by Ulead is included. Well it wasn't, instead there was VideoStuio 5.0 which I wasn't able make it work. Secondly, when I tried to contact ATI by email I was getting stupid autoreply totally unrelated to my question why ATI company is cheating their customers. I would call them but they charge you over [X] a minute for support. So the bottom line don't count on any support from ATI."
1,Great entertainment.,My two year old niece watched this movie about 5 times in a row. Who doesn't love Spongebob! Money well spent for some quiet time.
0,IT ISN'T FULL SCREEN IN THE BOX!!!,"I was so disappointed when I ordered this from Amazon! I hate widescreen and having the picture cut so I specifically ordered this so I can get FULL SCREEN! I opened the movie which said Full Screen on the front, only to find out the DVD inside was really WIDESCREEN! How could Amazon do that!? I wonder if they're just reselling movies. Very careless on their part and I would return it except I already threw the receipt away because I had assumed Amazon would get it right. Don't think I'll use Amazon again."
1,"Still great, but...","This is my sixth edition, and this book is still a great way to get ready for the season.But the writing has taken a distinct turn toward the serious. The essays and player profiles are still chock full of relevant numbers and piercingly well-considered arguments, but this year they are also somewhat...I really don't want to say it...tedious.What was once a light-hearted romp through some serious baseball thinking is now rather dense and dry. I'll buy again next year, but I hope somebody sends them a keg of Lighten-Up.+"
1,Read it aloud - in one sitting! Riveted!,"My boyfriend and I were on an 8 hour car trip and I had picked up this book out of curiosity. I started to read a passage to him that I enjoyed, and before I knew it, I was reading the ENTIRE book to him--we finished it on the drive! We even read it during our pitstops, we were so into it.Now, we are not sailing buffs--...-so I was surprised that I enjoyed this so much. Truly, folks--the disbelief this book leaves you with is priceless. One of the aspects I enjoy the most is that the author has obviously done his homework and lets you in on what these people SHOULD have done...and then tells you what they actually DID... These men were, in every way, to put it eloquently, extremely SCREWED. We found it almost hilarious, though a little grotesque at times. :pThis is NO Shackleton expedition...THOSE boys all came out of it ALIVE............Read it!"
1,Great Beginning. Great discussion of Justifcation.,"This book is worth it for the early discussion on the Catholic faith and then Dr. Schreck's discussion of Justification by faith and works. If you are like me, you might have a Protestant view of salvation. For me I could never quite reconcile this view with the book of James. If you are not quite sure of the Chhurch's position on faith, grace, works, salvation, etc., this book places it all in perspective and clearly explained. Th eother parts of the book were interesting, but not like the first third of the book."
1,Satisfied Reader,It's a very good story Hard to put down Story line is great Really got in to it Great read
1,What did you expect?,"Nice sounding CD as a whole. Finally, not a mention of ""bling bling"" on a current release. While many I am certain were hoping for a virtual replay of all of their favorite Clay songs sung during the American Idol competition, this set showcases what a nice voice this young man has. Sure, there is a tinge of ""predictability"" here. Then again, what did you expect? Sit back and enjoy it."
0,You can do better,"I ordered this sight unseen, and unfortunately cannot recommend other similar dictionaries. However, I found that this dictionary had significant gaps in the vocabulary covered. The cover boasted of coverage of insurance terms, but failed to include fairly basic insurance terms such as Hoechentschaedigungsgrenze (indemnification limit). Further, what listings the book does contain can best be described as bare bones. The entries indicate the gender of nouns, but do not include phoenetic pronounciations or suffixes for plural forms. I found the book to be of little assistance in my work. When I return to the market for such a dictionary, I will search for better option."
1,Awesome Blu Ray Set!,"This blu ray trilogy set is absolutely worth picking up. I do have all 3 movies on dvd, but this is one film franchise I don't mind double dipping into. The transfers to blu ray are spectacular. Great picture quality, and sound. My only complaint is that the special features for the first 2 films are non existent, but like I said, I have the dvds so if I needed to get my special feature fix then I could just pop those in. If your like me and love these movies, then do yourself a favor and get the set. You won't be disappointed!"
1,How it all came together,"This to me is the realistic view of the animals coming to Noah before the Ark was finished. Noah, his family and the animals became acquainted with each other before the flood. This is beautiful."
0,Spare us,"I purchased this CD for my wife for Mother's Day. After listening to it, it became very clear that Babs is way out of her league when she sings with singers the caliber of Il Divo (whom she refers to as ""swell"" by the way. Swell???). The continual platitudes such as ""children are like sponges"" etc. are boring. At 65 years of age she can at least try to come up with something new to say. As for her political persuasion, who cares!"
0,VERY Old Fashioned Views of Men and Women and Homosexuality,"While this book contains many helpful explanations of what to expect as your children grow it also contains WILDLY outdated depictions of men and women. Women are only described as working in the home - cleaning and baking. Men are described as working ceaselessly outside the home and having no time for children. The book was originally written in the 70s and it shows!In today's world where 70% of women work outside the home I found these depictions off-putting. I mean, wow, when I was a kid (and i'm 45) my mom worked outside the home.The greatest ding against the book though, is it's offensive depiction of homosexuality as a condition worthy of 'immediate psychological attention'. I am not gay, am married and have two children but if either of my sons are gay, I will support them and their choices with all my heart - not send them to a psychiatrist!"
1,Love pampers!,"Pampers is awesome, my baby girl has never had a rash since day 1 and she is almost 7 months now. This baby-dry theme is also very true because it holds a lot with out giving her any redness. Also, since its now flexible on the legs, its even much better for my baby girl to move around with it. In addition, I do highly recommend to subscribe to the amazon subscribe and save program. I don't have to worry about carrying a big box of pampers at the store, especially all the room it took on my grocey cart!! and at the same time watching my daughter. Now I get it delivered to my door, monthly, with free shipping and at a great price, ..WHAT MORE CAN I ASK FOR?? I highly recommend this service and PAMPERS... its the best!"
0,This is rubbish,"If you're a Heaven 17 fan, you're gonna be disappointed; if you like good techno, you're gonna be disappointed. It's just plain rubbish. There are one or two tracks that *might* warrant a second listening, but overall, the CD is annoying and a waste of money. Most of tracks have very little unity between H17 and the dance track, sounding like two songs mistakenly played together."
1,Outdated but insightful,"The author's style is captivating and simple. He was in Japan over twenty years ago, so I'm assuming that some if not much of his anecdotes may be regarded as dated over there. Regardless, a fun read which doesn't follow the stereotypical 'Japanese kids don't have fun' or 'Japanese people don't have individuality'."
0,Not for OTA users,"It is obsolete piece and requires paid subscription - the little thing I have overlooked. For just a little more you can get DVR with free OTA (Over the air) everything - for free. This one will go directly to a landfill. Without the activation it even can't be used as a ""VCR"". Piece of junk."
0,Bulky and heavy,Protection was my intention but I ended up carrying a brick in my pocket! It was easier to just carry the Palm TX without the cover. This was more of obstacle than protection.
0,Could be a lot better!!!,"Where do I start, how about I hate these diapers!! This gel stuff leaks out of them, all the time. They don't last long on active babies. Not to mention that I have to clean up leakage. Try another brand please!!"
0,"Horrible product, wish I could give it negative stars....","This is just a horrible product. If you want to waste $72 on a product that will ruin your skin, look no further. If you want to breakout horribly even if you don't normally and to have an awful rash on your face for days, this is the product for you. If you want to have to deal with a company that just doesn't care about anything except for making a quick buck, buy from MD Skincare."
1,Bill Engvall is more like 100 degrees ON cool!,Bill Engvall videos are almost always a good bet to be funny. 15 degrees Off Cool does not let you down! His vivid comedy leaves you in stitches throughout the entire show! This video is worth your time and money!
1,Dawn on a Distant Shore,"I found ""Dawn on a Distant Shore"" to be colorful and also a look into how life was in the late 1700's in America and Ireland. It continued with the lifes of the Bonner family and close friends and brought back some characters from the past that added more intrigue. I read through it quickly because I couldn't put it down. Start reading yours and you'll see what I mean."
0,Warnings for teachers trying to use this in your classrooms,"Here are the problems with using this in the classroom:1. The lines are not numbered, so students will have to number the lines as homework for every scene, or else you'll waste a lot of class time doing this.2. The paper quality is terrible for annotating: Mechanical pencil lead gets caught on the fibers, and any ink but ballpoint pens spreads out.3. Very few terms are annotated in the book, so you'll need to keep your own glossary inside the front cover because there's very little space to annotate.4. Prestwick House has an annotated copy with line numbers, plenty of space in the margins, high-quality paper, scene-by-scene glossary in the back, reader's tips for reading Shakespeare, and extra textbook-type help. Guess how much: 99 cents!"
1,Almost perfect reissue..missing at least a rare track that would make it PERFECT,"If you like Five Star, get this reissue. It's nicely packaged and the sound quality is definitely an improvement from the original cd issue. The bonus tracks are not really rare though. Even in America, they are easy to find. What's missing is the a 12inch remix of Let Me Be the One. It's called the 'dance remix' and was on some 12-inch's with the Philadelphia remix, depending on which catalog number was on the picture sleeve. Anyways, it's a slamming remix that mixed All Fall Down in the intro and includes scratching, sampling, and a different sax solo. That version would have made this reissue a MUST BUY!"
1,EXCELLENT!,"Purchased this book knowing full well it was outdated, but for a beginner in PDF forms this was and is and excellent purchase. Came through quickly and in Excellent condition. I would recommend this book to anybody who is starting out creating and making forms more user friendly. Great Job, can't wait till the next book gets released... please put it on Kindle, Nook and iPad versions as well as Print."
1,BEST BOOK EVER!!!,This is a must read! You don't even have to like historical. Excellent story. I have read this so many times my book fell apart and I went to buy hard cover.
1,"I was skeptical, but they work!","I have a new miniature dachshund puppy who is 7 weeks old. Before I brought her home I went to the local Petco the pick up some puppy pads, which are a foreign idea to me, having housetrained previous dogs on newspapers when I was growing up. However, I thought I would give them a shot. Of course there were about 5 or 6 brands to choose from, but I liked the idea that in theory these are extra special because of the ""just-cut grass"" smell they add. Well, I brought them home with low expectations, and I am not saying that she doesn't still have accidents, but I am amazed at how well she is responding to them! Maybe 75% of the time she seeks out the puppy pad on her own accord and uses it. I am about to run out; so I might buy regular pads and see if there is a difference. Overall, I would say they are worth a try, especially since they are only slightly more expensive. Good luck!"
1,love Pampers,"We love Pampers Baby Dry. We have used it with both of our boys. The economy size you get so many diapers for your money. Plus Amazon Mom gives a great discount. And if you can get any coupon codes, you can score a BIG discount on diapers. WE LOVE AMAZON!!"
0,Ballet Flat,"For it being a Clark Shoe, it had NO arch support. I returned item but had to pay the shipping."
1,Excellent stepping stone to world of SF!,"Folks, till foundation happened to me, I had for some inexplicable reasons never got introduced to world of science fiction (SF).(unless you call hitchhikers guide to galaxy as one) Based on influence of the die hard coterie of Asimov's fans, I decided to start my journey with Foundation...........and I have really found it cool stuff............worth reading and excellent investment of time..........since it rejuvenates you with fascinating ideas and terrific narrative. Looking forward to picking up the next one."
0,Helpful ? Not so much,"Myself being a second (father's side)and third generation (mother's side)Swedish-American, I find the suggested pronunciations to be inaccurate. Some of the sounds described in this book are not as my parents tried to teach me.Disappointed in Dallas."
0,"Well, it's Asimov","This book has all the Asimovian trademarks: intriguing ideas marred by utterly forgettable and indeed interchangeable characters, cringe-inducing dialogue, and a plodding storytelling style and pace. Later in his career Asimov fixed these problems *somewhat*, but at this point he was very young and they are present in full force. The unfortunate truth is that this book simply doesn't deserve the praise heaped upon it; it's some kind of herd mentality that leads to so many people venerating Foundation. If you are seriously into science fiction, then by all means read the entire Foundation series: it has historical importance and there is enjoyment to be had there. But I hate to think that there are people who are introduced to science fiction by this book."
1,A must read,"Both sad and hilarious at the same time, this book is a must read for anyone who wonders at our current criminal justice policy. Almost four decades of the drug war have produced no discernable reduction in drug use, but loads of folks in prison and a steady erosion of our constitutional rights."
1,Works great,"The charger works great and has a nice design. The cord could be a little longer, so you could use the phone more easily while it's connected to the charger."
0,Too many bible quotes & talk of SIN,"This is by far the worst book I have ever read on this topic. People with sexual addictions are not going to be helped by such bible-thumping judgments. So much talk of sin will only lead to more shame, not less. As Schaumburg recognizes that shame is such a large part of sexual addiction, you would think he would have avoided such heavy-handednessBesides, one has to assume that anyone bothering to read such a book already knows he/she has a problem. If they don't know, this will probably not convince them - it will only make them tune Shaumburg out as a throw-back to the '50s. It really is too bad, because the section concerning how to prevent sexual addiction in their child is very good."
1,In depth study,"This book is not all that hard to understand. In simple terms, Laband and McClintock tell us that we waste a lot of money trying to avoid someone else wasting our money. It's not this fact that puts the reader so off guard. The fact that our society spends about four hundred billion dollars trying to influence two trillion dollars in government expenditures (about twenty percent of the total) shows what an inefficient mess our economy has become. This fact of wasted wealth should shock the reader. I couldn't believe it at first. The amount of research used is impressive and definitive. Though Laband and McClintock don't offer any serious solutions to the drain on the economy, this volume helps shape the continuing debate about wealth transfer."
0,Not sure about veracity of the material,"The author begins with the statement that she has probably spiced up the material a lot. Since, most of the author's story is around her sexual encounters, and she has stated that she has spiced up the material, it is not clear how much truth exist in this autobiography. Read it with a grain of salt. The book, however, does provide some interesting insight on the Saudi society."
0,Way Out Of Date - Better Reference Available,"With all of the program changes, this book is very out of date. You can get a lot of the same information for free at http://www.certificationguide.com"
1,"A good, tight piece of FICTION.",People take these books too seriously. It is a work of FICTION that draws upon history. Read it and enjoy it for what it is. It's not the gospel.
0,Nowhere near Simpsons highlights,"Unfortunately these episodes date from the first 2 series, which were nowhere near as clever, inventive, subtle and hysterical as the later episodes. I really wouldn't bracket any of these as SImpsons classics, having seen maybe 200 episodes. 2 Cars In Every Garage is probably the best, marking the first appearance of a 3-eyed fish (a great insight into the surreal humour of the show's authors). Treehouse Of Horror was stylish and also very surreal, especially the first part. Bart Vs Thanksgiving, and Bart gets an F to an extent, falls into the pigeonhole of early episodes characterised by Bart doing somethig 'bad' (and personally I prefer seeing Homer be stupid) and neither are all that engaging, otehr than the superbly constructed Snow Day scenes. I wouldn't bother with this one."
1,Seduction Scenes - A Definite Turn On,"When I started reading the Seduction Scenes chapter I felt that sexual tingle of excitement...just by reading it I was turned on! I thought that part of me was dead. After being married for almost 17 years with two active boys, I find it difficult to take the time to really enjoy sex like we used to do. Lately, it has been nothing but ""quickies"" so that I can sleep! Both my husband and I are looking forward to experimenting more with the Seduction Scene Strategies and Role Playing. I was telling my girlfriend about the book and she can't wait to read it!"
0,Sigh,"I wish the Catholic bashing would stop; perhaps a way to do so would be a real 3rd secret. I finished this book just because I took it as total fantasy. If you put aside all the preconceptions about doctrine, Catholic history, etc., and are willing to just go for a ride without expecting the thing to make ""Catholic sense,"" the book can actually be rather enjoying in its plot. Of course, the actual 3rd secret (which has been revealed by everyone reviewing the book here) is ludicrous, but entertaining if you can set aside everything else. So it's what you expect; a Steve Berry novel, which has its own universe. You should expect to get what you know you are buying from this author, nothing more."
1,works great,This mold is great for what I need. Chocolate pops right out of the plastic. would buy again if needed
1,Beautiful Dress!,"I ordered this for a Christmas Party I will be attending this year. I ordered red, but became worried it would be more of a fire engine red...it actually turned out to be a deeper color and is GORGEOUS! I am absolutely happy with it. It was delivered quickly. I put it on this morning when I received it and it fits perfectly. The only issue I have is wanting a little shape to the bottom, so I'm having a bit of tulle put on the slip so that it will bell out a bit. However, I would recommend it...I'm a pretty big girl and it fits me well and looks great! Thanks!"
1,"Hard hitting, indenpendent cinematography, at it's finest!","This has got to be one of the best films i have been priveleged to see in a long time. The realism is just insane coming from such young actors. they just didn't play the part, they were it. There's moments in this masterpiece that you flat out forget you're watching a screen. a must see for anyone who likes good cinema."
0,Ok I guess,"This book was OK. I had to read it for school but I agree that it had way too many narrations in it and the only thing that captured the teens' feelings and thoughts were the scant entries from their diaries. This book didn't move me at all. If the author had put more of the kids' entries in it, it might be more effective."
0,Have not received my item in a month.,"My order was placed on August 28, but I have not received the printer in a month."
1,"Great rice cooker, poor instruction book","Although the rice cooker itself works great, the instruction book which comes with it is very poor. It doesn't even explain when to use which of the two slightly different sized cups the unit comes with. That said, it cooks white and brown rice beautifully and makes a terrific batch of steel cut oats oatmeal.One feature I wish it had was to give some indication of the approximate cooking time left to go. It only does so for the last few minutes of the process. Also, the built in clock doesn't seem to have a way to display North American convention 12 hour time and always displays in the 24 time format. The clock isn't important as we are surrounded by clocks on just about everything with a digital display these days, but it does show lack of attention to the local market. Then again, maybe there is a way to change the clock mode and I just can't find it in the manual!"
1,Great Set,This is a well made Backgammon set and the Movers have a good feel in your hand. Good quality dice and a set of rudimentary instructions. The case closes securely and is a nice size for a home set. Recommended.
0,Ninja Batman????,"Bruce Wayne trained as a ninja? He could single-handedly defeat all the other ninjas, including his mentors? He got all his weapons and gadgets from an inventor in his late father's company? Where did he park his batmobile when he was fighting thugs and rescuing his girlfriend? How did he drive the batmobile there without being noticed in the first place? The ninjas were going to kill him, but when the giant beam fell on him, they just left him alone, to be rescued by the butler???They tried to fit all the pieces in, but ended up leaving too many holes."
1,Brilliant,"Steinbeck's book Of Mice and Men is one of the most incredible works of American literature. It's a story about how two men try to achieve some semblance of success in Depression-era California. However, all of their hopes and dreams are shattered by the people around them. This is a must-read."
1,"""Carpet didn't match the curtains""","I was disappointed the product received didn't match the photo here; there was no flange on the top as indicated in the photo. The other drawback was the fact the holder was 'closed' at the bottom; I intended to use this as a net holder and wanted the handle to pass all the way through.Those things said...the vendor was very responsive to my request for return and full credit. Then, having had the weekend to consider, I was able to cut out the bottom of the liner sleeve, thus allowing the net handle to pass through as desired!I haven't had the boat on the water yet, but expect this unit to perform just fine."
0,Kundera was right to object,"The movie doesn't at all reflect the original book story in its core concept. If I didn't read the book before I wouldn't be able to guess what is the movie trying to explain. I doubt anybody, based on the movie only, would be able to understand what happend in 1968 in the Czech republic and what was the consequence for the entire society."
1,Great boot. Light but rugged.,This boot is well constructed for a light weight boot. I experienced minimum break in time with no hot spots. Good support and quite comfortable. I have not hiked in wet conditions so I cannot speak to the water proof feature. The boot runs true to size. I would buy another pair if these were damaged or lost.
1,Robert Clark and the Olsen twins,"I saw this movie and i thought that the twins were really good.But,I really like the way that Robert Clark played Helmet Head.Keep showing more movies with him."
0,Let's hope this is also the end,"This movie reminded me of a very long music video without the music (other than the bombastic soundtrack). The plot is very thin and rife with cliches, and the characters are very poorly developed. Christian Bale conveys anger well, but his character makes no other demands upon his acting ability. Katie Holmes is almost forgettable; what separates her from a thousand other 20-something starlets is not evident in this film. Finally, I understand that Gotham is a dark place; but this film is so visually dark that it is often difficult to discern the action. Only Michael Caine is palatable, although even his character is one-dimensional.I expected much more from Christopher Nolan, whose Memento and Insomia were remarkable for their complex yet coherent plots. Like John Dahl, Bryan Singer and Curtis Hanson before him, Nolan appears to be another young director with great potential who has decided to cash in on his reputation while he still has one."
1,Great movie,Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian is a great movie because it was in blu ray and everyone should watch and own it.
1,Not the usual CS Lewis,"Having heard much about this book from a Wheaton professor, I finally read it with an expectation of receiving great insight. For that, I will have to re-read, I think. There are hints of truths, some of which I know I missed, since I am accustomed to didactic presentations. Didn't quite realize until the end that it is indeed a retelling of an old myth. At any rate, it is an interesting read, even if taken only superficially."
0,no sale,"The DVD set lacks CC for the hearing impared. I think this is kind of strange, considering one of the characters is going deaf."
1,Too bad it did not bring the Mask,"My 4-year old girl loved the costume but unfortunately it did not include the mask. I inquired the seller and they confirmed there was a confusion : the description of the Costume did not include a mask , I replied even I did not notice it in the description, the picture showed the girl with the mask and there was no clarification about it. I think they should have made a clarification, it seems to me it is false publicity. It is good to know they have updated the picture."
0,Wow...,"Alright so this thing really needs a warning label on it. ""WILL FREEZE WHEN TRYING TO SKIP SONGS"" This stupid contraption lead me in the end to just break it. It freezes up when I try and skip a song, I have to try and turn the damn thing off before I can even go to the main menu after I've used it for about a half hour. The battery life is great, really, but it's just not worth it when it's playing and it goes to the next song, but the screen says it's one minute into the last song previous it was playing. Basically, you can't skip the song if you wanted. Nice going Sansa, you made a piece of crap."
1,I Can See Clearly Now.....,"The picture quality is among the best I have seen for a blu-ray. The sound quality is pristine. I rocked the house playing it through my home theater system. The reason it got 4 stars was for the lack of special features for both Spider-man and Spider-man 2. This set included Spider-man 2.1(Extended Version), which was nice, so the trilogy is almost a quadrilogy. I waited for a price-drop since I had all on dvd prior to my purchase."
0,Leave this one to the bibliophiles,"Yes, I am a 17 yr old high school kid. But I can tell good books from the bad ones. ""The Scarlet Letter"" is a ""classical"" tale of 2 lovers. To be concise, this novel is too wordy to be enjoyable. People can say it's a classic romantic novel, it has good character developments, it has good themes and ironies, blah blah blah. I, like most people, don't judge a book by checking out its trap metaphors; all in all leave this book to a ""Doctor of Puritanical Philosophy"". If youre looking for a more entertaining classic, read ""Huck Finn"" by Twain."
0,Pocket Neopets,"I got this toy during the summer of '03 so I could have something to do on a long roadtrip I was going on. I love neopets, and I thought that a pocket neopet, would be similar to the site. Well it's not. It really boring. There is only four games that you can play. Negg Drop, Techno Says, Poogle Races and Fruit Machine. After about 20 minutes I got bored with the games. You can only earn Neopoints(neopets money) for the first couple of times you play. So I decided that I would buy some food and a toy for my neopet. Well there is only like 3 toys you can buy and 3 items of food you can buy. It's pretty boring. There is nothing else that you can really do. I put it in my junk drawer and havent taken it out sense. This is definatly not worth your money!"
1,looking for facts,"there must be someone who knows the answer to this: the baby as per wikipedia, says the baby was due 06/28/66 - My Question is: what day did the baby actually get delivered - ppl have told me yrs. ago it was 06/26/66 - any help would be appreciated!!!"
1,Better than I remembered,"I read this book when I was 12 for school and it schoked me then. It shocked me even more the second time around. It is a"" timeless Must Read"". RIP R. Bradbury"
1,An Unfound Gem,"This band has a straight forward approach to music that is sturdy, simple, aggressive and a little annoying, in a good way. The often frenetic lead guitar is right up front to create a classic rustic American sound. This band must like Blind Willie McTell as they cover Dying Crapshooters Blues and mention Mctell in their original track Down at Danny's. If you are looking for something different with a classic American roots music sound - this is a nice find."
1,"If I could give it more stars, I would!!","I have to say that I really really enjoyed this book. As soon as I was finished I drove over to my parents house to give it to them to read!There are some many mysteries surrounding the sightings of Mary, the mother of Jesus and putting them into this book with its conspiracy plot was magic. Although it puts some aspects of the Catholic Church in a bad light (and I'm Catholic), it is a work of fiction to be enjoyed on that level! I hope to read any other books by Steve Berry as I'm sure that they will be as wonderful as this was!"
0,Too boring,My one year old loves 5 of the Sesame Street DVDs we ordered for her. This one however was a total dud. There wasn't much here to keep a kid's interest and the educational value was marginal at best. Look elsewhere.
0,Relaxing viewing time,A DVD of clear good photography and quite pleasant to watch but a little embarrasing in family company. Really only suitable for watching in private.
0,Dangerously flawed,"Galbraith is an economist who could only operate in academia--in any other setting he would be a joke. In his many books, which are widely cited, he attempts to provide an economic justification to socialism. The principle flaw in this book, from which all the others radiate out, is that all spending is equal. That government spending is just as productive to the economy as personal or corporate spending. He uses this assumption to justify confiscation of wealth by the government through the tax code. Of course, we know now that most of the taxes collected by the government is at best wasted money, and at worst counterproductive to society (welfare, subsidies, foreign aid to countries that hate us, etc.)All that being said, I highly recommend reading this book. It's important to know the enemy."
0,great movie massacred by tape quality,"One of my all time favorite movies has been edited for television recorded extended long play, and packaged as though nothing was done to it. don't buy this tape wait for the dvd version that should be coming out soon."
1,A unique piece of history,"A veteran ABC Newcaster during the turmoil in the south in the 60's and 70's and an individual who met and befriended H Ross Perot, Murphy Martin gives in inside look from his vantage point of the events of Martin Luther King, the Kennedy Assination and some of Ross Perot's most incredible exploits. It is well written and full of interesting tidbits of the personalities of the day."
1,10 Channel Mixer,I bought this mixer for my husband off his wish list. He was very excited and loves it!!!!!
1,Amazing!,"For ten years I've had chronic lower back pain from a gnarly snowboarding accident that really affected my surfing, my work, and my active life. I tried pretty much everything -- physical therapy, tons of stretching, chiropractic care -- and nothing really provided nay lasting results.A friend of mine recommended trying yoga as a remedy, but I never took it seriously until I saw the Yoga for Surfers video. I figured I'd buy the tape and give it a try (heck, I tried everything else!). And after two months, I was virtually pain free! I've been doing it for 6 months now and it has been an amazing turnaround. I also picked up Yoga for Surfers II and I'm working my way into that routine.When my dad told me he had back pain, I also got him this dvd, and I know he'll love it."
1,Truly and excellent book.,"Actually, I rate this an 11. This was the first, and the fifth, and the last Clavell novel that I have read (yes, I read it three times). Clavell even coproduced an excellent movie adaptation in the late 60's (though filmed purposely in black and white) which captured the entire mood of the book. The reason that this book works so well is that Clavell himself lived the story. The character of Peter Marlowe is based on Clavell himself, and it shows.This book is a brutal, depressing display of humanity at its basest. Not for the light hearted, but a must for anyone interested in WWII or in Asia."
1,I Love This CD,"Mesmerizing vocals, meaningful songs, and outstanding pop music arrangements is what this CD is all about. I love Clay Aiken's singing!!! I love this CD, and you will too."
0,Muddled ending disapoints,"The good: The basic plot line is interesting- a man who has just been killed by the electric chair has his finger print turn up at a murder scene. The writing itself is good. The main character Kay Scarpetta and an old professor of hers are well `fleshed out'.The bad: Other characters are not well `fleshed out'. The plot never fully explains itself. Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes - or is it about Scarpetta - redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her - after developing an anti-social workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one? The latter seems to be the path the author choose - leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved. Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain (on many different levels - as a family member, as a friend and as a professional) in the end her `goodness' is redeemed. How the bad guys in the story turn out seems to be unimportant - which I found to be a major flaw."
0,Doesn't work,"I received this item and it;s dead!Doesn't work and I cannot return it. wasted $40 bucks..I'm so angry, I bought this as a gag gift for my friend for a party and now i'm out money...Very disappointing..."
0,"If you read the book, don't watch the movie!","I really enjoyed this book, but I was very disappointed by the movie. Rather than a story about the Italian countryside and the adventure of remodeling a home in a foreign country, this movie was about a divorced woman looking for love and her gay friend's dramatic life. Blah. I had wanted to see the charming Polish workers and the quaint Italian villages that were an important part of the original story. Oh well, this wasn't the movie for me."
0,not the best book!!,"well first of all i thought that this was the worst night world book in the series and believe me i have and read all 9 of them. Gillian is just so shallow and a little sissy the only thing she wants is to be popular and have David as her bf like its the most important thing in the world!! i thought David was stupid too he seem to only fall in love with Gillian because of her transformation to being well liked he was just being shallow and really stupid. i think Gillian and David are the most stupidest characters in the entire night world series!! so far this was not the best book so far. the only part i liked was where Ash showed up i was totally happy when he was in this book. he is just funny and such a hottie to be with. the other books i recomend is Witchlight, Daughters of darkness, Soulmate, The chosen, and Black dawn."
1,An exciting adventure,"As one of the 100 greatest books written, at least this book doesn't leave you wondering why. It's a classic in it's sense of adventure, sci fi, and originality. Relatively short, this book keeps your interest throughout and it's main character of Captain Nemo is a true joy. In summary, a very entertaining book."
0,Very Penetrating,"Rumor has it that Cinnamon Moonpie (better known as C-Murder) had wanted to title his CD ""Trapped in a Man's Ass"", but his handlers warned that it might dampen sales. They also forced him to change some of the more explicitly homoerotic lyrics into more standard gangsta bling-bling tropes. Personally, I think the original concept would have been a refreshing change of pace. I've been waiting for a long time for a rapper with the guts to admit he's not afraid to love another man in the most intimately physical way. We've known for years about CM's tastes and proclivities, but the hypocrisy of the music biz forces gay rappers to hide their true nature beneath transparent macho posturing, lest they alienate their more dimwitted, less progressive fans. But if you read between the lines, it's pretty clear what they're really on about.Say it loud, say it proud, my beautiful gay black brothers!"
1,Something I'll Never Grow Tired Of!!,"For years and years, I always had to watch A Charlie Brown Christmas on broadcast television. I could never miss it! I finally missed it this year, and had to buy the DVD. Now, I will still watch it, even in the dead of summer. Even though there's nothing extra on the DVD, it's still fun to have it around for whenever you feel like watching it! A must have for kids and adults, alike!"
1,Enchanting and Creative,I wasn't sure if this was a novel for preteens at first glance. But upon finishing it did surpass my expectations. Of course I do love almost all fiction novels. Any book that's can get lost in.
0,Didn't work,Tried to play on two different Blu-ray players and it simply would not play. I could only get it to play on my computer. No good.
0,Glue failing,"Good looking shoes, but...after just 1 month,the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends. The shoe still looks perfect, but I had to use shoe goo to fix it. Seems like for the price, and for as long as this style has been around it shouldn't so this?!"
0,Not the best in zombies,"I was very excited about reading this book, especially knowing it was a series. The hope to carry characters through a cataclysm is one that intreges me. Unfortunatly, although the concept around the story is a good one, the characters are incredibly unsympathetic. They are either bickering or whining, even close moments when you feel that they are going to connect it turns into a confronation. At the end I really didn't care if they lived or died.And the language is unbelievably harsh, yes, I don't mind the occasional f-bomb, but at times it seemed unrelenting. If you agree with this review and have read the other books and Mr Moody's writing style has changed please let me know."
1,toni estes HOT HOT HOT!,THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF THE BEST OF THE YEAR.ITS IN THE SAME MOULD AS DESTINYS CHILD BUT THERE ARE MORE UPTEMPO TRACKS.IF I HAD TO PICK MY FAVOURITE SONG IT WOULD HAVE TO BE HOT.BUY THIS ALBUM YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED.
0,Doesn't lock well,"The accuracy of the rule and ruggedness of construction seem satisfactory. Unfortunately the lock mechanism doesn't work well, the rule moves when pushed even when the rule is locked tightly. I cannot tighten the lock enough to keep the rule from moving when it is forcefully pressured."
1,Gregg Braden brings us a valuable book,"This book by Gregg Braden is fantastic in the best possible way. It is packed with answers that make sense. I had originally borrowed the book from my spiritual teacher, and I had to remove many sticky notes that I had used to mark important information when I returned it, months late. I had no choice but to get my own copy. I will re-read this a number of times, and I have returned to select passages many times already. Thank you Gregg, for sending this information out into this world!"
1,Excellent signal,"A few points I'd like to share:1. Excellent reception - I'm using Linksys router with DD-WRT firmware and this card picks up consistant 5-bar signal. I've previously had Buffalo Airstation WLI2PCIG54S in the same machine and it only had around 2-bar of signal strength (same location.)2. Antena cable is about long enough to put it on top of a midsize tower.3. I run RaLink (for chipset RT61) on XP machine instead of the MSI supplied driver, also configured thru Window wireless option. So far, it's been stable, no drop signal.For price/performance ratio, I think this is a great choice."
0,"Worse than Amorica, and that says a lot","This album is definately a low point in their great career. I thought Amorica was the result of them taking too many drugs. I think this album is just the opposite; they are completely sober on this one. I am not an advocate of drug useage, but ""Southern Harmony"" was brilliant for Chris Robinson's imaginative psychedelic induced lyrics and the Crowes slightly stoned hard-rock blues. This attitude is also evident on their awesome debut and other great album ""Three Snakes"". They lost their grit on this one, complete with over-production and lackluster typical rock and roll lyrics about love. A let down from previous great Crowes albums."
1,human character in constant conflict between strong forces,"Good literature provides keen observations in behaviors and psychology of human beings when faced with moral choices and consequences, and this book definitely is filled with good stuff. The main character, Mr. Henchard, is severely flawed and his iniquities are multiple, and yet, he also is so human and really hard not to have sympathetic feelings toward him in the end. The writing is wonderfully philosophical and dramatic, especially the last paragraph of Elizabeth-Jane's reflection on life is movingly insightful."
1,"Dynomax 17340, Jeep Cherokee","Geart system!!!,this is my second one on my JeepVery easey install, just cut the old one off with sawzall.Comes with everything you need except the metric bolts.Just go down to the local hardware and get stainless.Love the stainless tip, polish it up with a little rubbing compound and looks great.Good deep sound and just loud enough for me.Thanks,RR"
0,sucks,i just got one word this movie blows one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time the first part of the movie put my wife to sleep. any body who reads this it is not even take the time our the money to by this movie
0,notorious for phantom paper jams,"Mine worked well for the first year and then it started thinking that it had a paper jam. The printer would pick up a sheet of paper, feed it half way through then stop, saying there was a paper jam. There was no paper jam. The printer just thought there was. Upon doing a little research I discovered, much to my chagrin, that this is an all to common problem with this model. Do a search on 'HP Photosmart 2575 paper jam' and you'll see the same reviews I did. It's too bad that HP has not fixed the problem or even addressed it anywhere on their website.I've always liked HP products but you would be taking a big chance if you were to purchase this particular model. It might work fine but it might also render itself useless by the phantom paper jam. There's just no way to know which route your printer will take."
1,Great fit for 70# lab mix,"I bought this as a gift for a friend who has a 70# lab-shar-pei mix. Even though this dog's head is a bit smaller than the one pictured on the front of the product, it fit perfectly and my friend has seen great results in her walks with her dog, who used to pull like mad, but is now behaving really well thanks to this little contraption."
1,Incredibly engrossing,"I absolutely loved this book, it was so engrossing, could not put it down. Hawthorne has wonderful descriptions, it is a fascinating time in history and he brings it alive. A flawless book."
0,Constant Rash,"Great price for this product, but it caused both of my kids to have rashes. I ended up going out and buying another kind to mix with them so the rash would subside enough that we could use the diapers without wasting money and having to throw them away. These also don't have elastic in the back waistband of the diaper...another really nice feature in other brands."
0,Jawbone Repair Kit? Maybe,"In an odd case of poor quality control, the package of eargels came with two of one of the six sizes and missing one of the others. I bought them to make my Jawbone headset fit. It's better than it was, but still not ergonomic."
0,Book,"This book is confusing, it jumps around to much, to many generations in the book. I could not understand this book at all."
1,Good value,This product was delivered by provider on time and the quality is better the original I bought directly from my cell phone provider and way cheaper! The only down side is that the cord is short so it is difficult to talk on the phone while it's charging (unless you are hands free).
1,"Excellent plastic, very convenient size","This plastic is very conveniently shaped for running around the house - I have previously bought plastic materials that have to be cut to size and did not find them handy as this one. Very fast shipping from seller, too."
0,8 Crazy Nights,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! One reviewer states, ""the funniest Christmas movie ever"". This could not be farther from the truth. I like many of A. Sandler's movies. However, this movie sucked really bad. It was crude and not funny (reindeer pooping and eating poop?...come on!). It was irritating and not funny (the old man's voice was so grating, it made you want to scream five minutes into the movie). Most of all, the movie was boring and embarrassing to watch in mixed company. I still can't believe I wasted $4.00 to rent it."
0,It is all untruths...lies!,"I was there for two years, there are very few if any real facts in this movie, on the Extras Disc the advisers and statisticians did not tell the truth...The movie is a lie!"
0,Works,It was a bit confusing to assemble. Had to redo a few times before I got the right rods with the right utensils. In the end you get what you paid for - bottom of the line product for cheap.
1,This is an amazing book.,"This book was required summer reading 2 years ago for my english II AP class. I thought it was really an amazing book. I loved the main character how strong willed she was even though she was more human and not cave man. I thought Auel did a great job writing it, but sometimes she was too descriptive about setting of the story. Description and imagery is good, but too much of it takes away from the story. I have read the rest of the series, but if you like this book you should read the others that go along with this series.thank you for your time,Loran"
1,THE MAGIC ORANGE TREE,Is a really good book!!! Easy for kids to learn. I will recommend this book to other family. I PERSONALLY ENJOY READ TO MY LITTLE ONE.
1,Helpful and Thorough,Hartley does a great job with structure and background. I had hoped to see a bit more interaction with the actual grammar although he does a very good job interacting with semantic and lexical questions. He also does well tracing larger Biblical Theological motifs. I recommend this volume highly.
1,Great film but track down the (easy to find) uncut version!,"Many Takeshi Kitano fans hate this film but I actually find it to be his most enjoyable. If you liked Sonatine, then you will like this. However this is the American version of the film and it is HEAVILY CUT AND EDITED! Poorly cut and edited too may I also point out. Some parts which were clear and easy to understand in the original become confusing due to the editing. Have no fear THE ORIGINAL UNCUT VERSION IS EASY TO FIND. I recommend this edition of the film:Brother (Uncut release!)which is awesome."
0,Disappointed with the sound quality,"If you buy concerts on DVD because of the great sound, skip this one. I was amazed that George Martin and all those experienced players allowed such an amateurish recording to happen. Some of the performances were disappointing: Mark Knoffler seemed to be drunk and/or on autopilot, Paul McCartney made my throat sore hearing him attempt to hit high notes that he can't quite manage anymore."
1,"Gad Zuks, Batman!","No calories, no carbs, just great taste to add to coffee anywhere you are. I keep it in my purse. This stuff is great!"
0,mothman-putting the loose ends together?,"I found the movie leading in many directions....Why was John's wife appearing in Point Pleasent? Was this the mothman? Why did John appear for Gordon 3 nights at 2:30 a.m? These questions were never answered in the movie.... or did I miss something? The movie ran long for me, maybe because of the loose ends. I could be wrong, you decide. Go see the movie......"
1,"""El Dorado...as good as gold""","Elton John returns with 11 very seductive tracks on this release. The melodies are strong and he sounds great! Particular stand-outs include ""Someday Out Of The Blue,"" which is the first single, ""Trust Me,"" ""My Heart Dances,"" and ""Friends Never Say Goodbye."" A few more EJ tracks would have been better than the instrumentals included at the end of the album. Overall this is a fine body of work. The first single is probably the catchiest of the songs on this release, and a good follow-up single to this one would be ""Trust Me."""
1,Numbers Puzzle,"I bought this puzzle for my son because we can't afford day care prices and need some things to work with him at home on the basics like ABC's, Numbers, Colors and Shapes. I have nearly every educational puzzle that Melissa and Doug have put out and I love them all."
1,A glorious film!,"This is a wonderfully entertaining film. Sidney Poitier is charming anddelightful as Homer Smith. Homer experiences car trouble on a desert road. He receives assistance from a group of nuns in a nearby retreat.He obliges by doing chores for the nuns. The superior nun persuades himto build them a chapel. Homer is at first reluctant, but soon the projectbecomes as important to him as it is to the nuns. Poitier received a well-deserved Oscar for his role. Lilia Skala was nominated for BestSupporting Actress as the leader of the nuns. A spiritually feel-goodfilm. Excellent. (4 stars out of 5)"
0,Didn't fit,"Although good quality product, it doesn't fit my ear at all. None of the sizes fit comfortably or snug. I can't use it at all and just wasted my money."
0,Not My Style,"I got interested in this group as I was looking at a U-Tube video that utilized the song ""Lullaby"" from the Bond Classified album as back-drop music. I was so mesmerized by the tune I bought every Bond album there was available as well as this Live video. Unfortunately, for me - all the other songs on all the other albums were nothing like the ""Lullaby"" song and quite honestly, I threw everything else in the trash. This is not to say that the group plays bad music or are untalented in any respect...This type of Techno-Symphony is just not my speed...I prefer soft rock as opposed to this."
1,Good Unit,"I've already dropped it, (unit was off) and it's fine. It's a little larger than I expected, so is more of a pocket unit than an armband or clip-on. The creative software is not too good - I did some searching and found some recommendations for Notmad Explorer - which does truly rock as accessory software for the Nomad. It will copy over playlists from most other media players without a hitch- which was problematic with the Creative application. Overall I'm pleased with the purchase."
1,A great Baby pillow!,"This is just an adorable little pillow. It will be great as an added decoration in my baby room. Remember this is a BABY pillow, so it is smaller and not made for an adult. The person who previously gave this pillow a rating thought it was too flat and small, but I found it was perfect for a baby room:) Plus! It's a perfect match to the Nautica 4 piece crib set."
1,Batman Begins Anew!,"This is the best superhero movie ever made, and I have seen them all.Batman makes Spiderman look like a total loser.This and Batman (1989) are the only movies of batman worth seeing. The Joel Schumacher renditions are utter CRAP!As Christian Bale said when getting an award for his role in Batman Begins ""It is great that Chris [Nolan] has finally brounght back some DIGNITY to the greatest superhero of all time..."" That is a semi-quotation of what he said, you get the idea.This movies is totally amazing, I can't wait to see ""The dark Knight"", whcih began filming this month (March), and will be out next year.I have no doubt it will be amazing, just as this film is.BUY IT!"
1,An escapist reading classic,"I originally read these books in my early teens. It is an escapist guilty pleasure to revisit them in my 50's. Campy, but classic. I'd highly recommend for anyone who enjoys sci-fi/adventure tails."
0,there was no entry for zero stars....,"Bad, bad, stupendously awful! Really bites the big one. That's probably what Leonard Pinth Garnell (sp?) would have said on the old Sat. Night Live show. What a big disappointment this film was. We are huge fans of the original, and went to see it with high hopes. It seems that most of the rest of the viewers felt the same way; people were restless, chatting and getting up to get more snacks. When Owen Wilson loses his head, instead of screams, the theater filled with sardonic laughter. Neeson phoned his performance in, Lili Taylor was wasted, and Zeta-Jones, well, as an actress, she is very pretty."
1,Good movie,This is a classic and always good. I used it for my students in class as Charlie Brown never goes out of style.
1,great movie,"have always loved the movie, finally decided to purchase it was glad i found it at amazon for really cheap! :) including shipping i only paid $3!! thanks amazon!"
1,If only Hollywood could offer something this good,"I saw the previews for this movie while waiting for my main feature it seemed interesting so I remembered the title and I am so glad I did. Excellent story, excellent acting without it be overdramatized. I will add this to my collection."
0,Not what I expected,"When I was younger I had a crocadile dentist that you actually pulled the teeth out, thats what I was expecting. This was a travel size one that all you do is push the teeth, not very fun. My 4 year old broke it in less than a week, but we were not too upset! Not a bad toy for a road trip, but owuldn't recommend it for a family game."
1,Intriguing story,"While I don't consider it the best of Ms. Feehan's books that I have read, The Scarletti Curse is an intriguing story that is very solid. The protaganists are believable and interesting. If you like Ms. Feehan's books I can recommend this one as an addition to your library."
1,Engrossing story!,"I picked up the Kindle version of this book when Amazon made it free for a limited time, and I'm so glad they did (it worked out for Amazon too, because I purchased the other two books as soon as I finished this one). I had kind of fallen out of reading for pleasure and just bought the Kindle. This was my second book I read on it and I loved it so much that I've been reading like crazy ever since. Lawhead totally pulls you into the world he creates. The characters, environment, battles, and problems are all well developed and you end up totally engrossed. I'm glad it was a trilogy and not over after only this one book.A great read for any fantasy fan."
1,The Way is Was,"Great look at the past of striped bass fishing on the Cape. Money, politics and fishing competition made this a great read for the avid bass angler. A time never to be visited again. The man became intergrated into the life cycle of the striped bass. As the seasons and years changed , so did the man, so did the politics, so waned the competition, so lost was the inner workings of his family. A time to remember and a time remember less."
1,Of Mice and Men,"This action packed book was filled with laughs, and tears. George Milton and Lennie Smalls are best friends. They have been working together for life, and one day plan to have a little house with crops and animals. They both go to work on another farm, and it seems to be working out for them, so that one day their dream can come true. But then Lennie gets into big trouble that costs two peoples lives and affects many others."
1,Up From Slavery,This book is a must for todays generation and for those who feel in a minority. It is a great encouragement as to what a person or group of people can do if they set the mind to it and are willing to exert some effort. There have been times that my wife and I cleaned toilets for a living and we determined to do the best job we could. This book helps me to have another reason as to why we did that.
1,Beautiful MOH Dress,"I bought this dress for my daughter, who is my Maid of Honor at my upcoming wedding. The dress is gorgeous! The perfect shade of red. The style is beautiful. The dress shipped and arrived faster than expected..which is always great! A great buy!"
1,IT'S GREAT!,"All the other reviews say this product is boring and ""save your money""....Well my daughter & I LOVE IT!You get to pick one of three pretty girl skaters, You pick her one of, AT LEAST 15 costumes. Somebody said the skater ""never falls""?? Thats boloney. She falls plenty until you develope the hand eye coordination this FUN, FUN game takes. It's a GREAT cd.rom for any age. Have some fun for pete's sake! This world is SO NEGATIVE! I Highly Recommend Barbie Sparkling Ice Show!!!"
0,"The Political Paranoids' ""Gospel of Orwell""","Orwell is one of the most overrated novelists of this century. He's nothing more nor less than a second-rate hack who profiteered by preying on the worst fears of modern man. Today, his book is the modern bible of the paranoid disgruntled white male and other conspiracy nutcases. Yet another fairy tale, albeit a grown-up one, warns us to LOOK OUT for that proverbial boogy man--Big Brother, in this case, being the latest in a long line of aliases he goes under. Perhaps Orwell's ""Newspeak"" should include these additions: ""Propaganda is Truth""; ""Truth is Absolute""; ""Freedom springs from Fear""; ""Extremism is Virtue."" This book has never made anyone stop to think, but, instead, to fear and hate one more faceless abstraction. Contemporary paranoia gets a much more powerful portrayal in the works of Thomas Pynchon, such as ""The Crying of Lot 49."" At least IT has the virtue of being well written."
0,Boring!!!,"This is supposed to be a romantic comedy, yet there are no comic moments. I could see the potential for comedy, but it just wasn't there. Maybe it's Diane Lane or maybe it's the director. I kept wondering if Lane was playing a teenager or an adult. I couldn't get involved with the character at all. She seemed to be faking it all the way through. I would've given no stars, but I thought the Italian countryside deserved at least 1 star."
1,Sobre Los Reyes Malditos,"es una excelente obra , es el inicio de una saga muy interesante. a pesar de ser una novela , su sentido histórico es completo, su adaptación al contexto tambien, de verdad la recomiendo, a todas aquellas personas que os guste leer novelas, obras y escritos entre otros, reales o ficticios relacionados del siglo XI al siglo XVI."
1,Delicious,"This is a wonderful, quiet and relaxing CD that I find Iput on quite often. MB has a wonderful voice that canjust about sing anything. If you want good music try thisCD and then look up and find the rest of his music. Hewasn't awarded England's top male singer in the past 25 yearsfor nothing. He certainly is my favorite singer and I willcontinue to purchase every album and every video he puts out."
1,An incredible piece of work!,"This book, by Elizabeth Winthrop was one of the best books I've ever read. It was a real page turner! The end of every chapter left me wanting to read on. If you love fantasies too, I strongly recommend you pick up this one today!"
1,Nice shirt!,"Of course, it is just another white shirt--but a great one for the price, and my husband loved it."
1,Get This Player!,"Before I decided to get this player, I did my research. I looked up the ipod, the dell jukebox, and the samsung napster player. I chose this one because from what I read, it was the best deal for the money. Another reason I got it is because you can put WMA files on it. That takes up half the space of MP3's. That's important because I have a lot of music. The software is great. you can sort your music by artist, title, album, or genre, and you can play music based on those categories. transfering is easy, the software makes everythig pretty easy. even the battery life is great- it advertises 14 hours, it's actually a little less but still good. only 1 problem, no accessories...yet. I hope it's because it's new and they are not out yet, but being without a remote is hard. They player's interface itself is also very easy to use. can't complain and I recommend it over all the other players, just hope that remote will come out soon. GET IT, IT'S WOTH EVERY PENNY!!"
1,"I wanted to say ""Damn!""","...but I had to expound on that on account of all these bad reviews.If this book is not for you to get then that's fine and it's sad, but don't be so angry--coherence isn't everything. It's the heart that makes Kerouac, the sailing, pounding, beautiful, soulful, angry, churning, palpable heart.And for those who worry that this is required scene material, the beat poets are dead, let them be. Read for yourself and its own rewards. That should be obvious; now go, enjoy this epic soul journey."
0,I cannot believe...,"I cannot believe that people would give this film 5 stars. I forced myself to watch the entire film just because I could not believe that someone would actually recommend this film. Yea it has an interesting twist, but it gets real painful after a while. If you love it, god bless..."
1,This is Great! Get Real...,"Okay, let's face it, it's all about time and there's just too little of it. With this cookbook, not only can you recapture some of that time but you can also serve up some absolutely scrumptious meals and snacks. I know the purists all rave about the use of packaged prepared foods, but come on, who today has time to cook from scratch? Statistics prove that fewer people cook from scratch and get bland, pedestrian fast food, with Semi Homemade Cooking anyone can be a ten minute maestro of the kitchen."
0,Cheap quality and non-existant service,After using the charger for about 2 weeks I started noticing drops in the power feeding to the iBook. After about 2 months the charger stopped working altogether. On inspection I noticed that the metal part of the plug was separating from the plastic part and I suspect this is causing the disconnect. MacAlly has no warranty information on their web site and I called them several times only to be diverted to a messaging system and I never got a callback.I'd say avoid if you can.
1,Great little machine!,"I don't normally go out of my way to write reviews, but I do appreciate reading them before I buy....so here's one for those considering buying this for their ""second office"" application. I've had this printer for 3 months now, and it's great for my home office (where I work when I'm not in my office office). Footprint is tiny, no problems with paper feed (like prior top-feed printers I've had), print quality good and crisp, and printouts appear instantly. Good work HP."

0,Buy the Original Version,This version does not include the gruesome illustrations of the original that still haunt me every once in a while. The book has been controversial because of the uncensored gore and terrifying images. This version is compromised fluffy camping-trip stories.
1,Nice Job!,"I received this CD as a gift at Christmas and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised how good this recording is and enjoyable to listen to. If I had not received ""Measure of a Man"" as a present, I have to admit I most likely, would not have bought it. Only having gained my knowledge about Clay from the constant media barrage during the ""American Idol"" frenzy and having only seen the final episode of the contest, I really had not heard much from this singer before the CD. I do admit I was impressed by Clay during the ""Idol"" finale (and, yes, he clearly deserved to win as Ruben, although a seemingly nice fellow, sings out of tune). ""Measure of a Man"" is a solid collection of pop rock and a nice showcase for Clay's pleasant tenor. His voice, though a bit generic, shows some good stylistic touches that really help to elevate the quality of the material.A good job by Clay Aiken all around and a very listenable CD."
0,HOW TO RUIN AND DESTROY A SONG... FOR MONEY,What happened with Ozzy and Co? Man this is a classic from the 70's...! a gem from Black Sabbath's vol 4 and I can't understand why Ozzy and Co (Sharon Obsbourne of course) can take a song like this to ruin and destroy it like a pop trash on the voice of this little stupid girl called Kelly (yes with Ozzy but ...) And all for money.If you want to hear the real thing go for Vol 4!
1,Sorry!,"I mistaked review sentence!(T-T) I correct a mistakes! Music number17 is not ""Kenchan..wormmonnotheme"". Correct number is 12!! I'm sorry..(T-T) This CD is Saiko-!!(excellent)"
1,The book that tought me color.,"Itten's analysis and application of color is thoughtful and scientific. As a practicing art director, I have successfully used the theories and methods explained in ""Elements of Color"" for over twenty years. I also teach them to my design classes. Whether you use a paintbrush or a mouse, his ""seven color contrasts"" will prove invaluable."
0,rocket science,I cannot wait to return this item to Babies R Us. I tried to assemble it at home and the only thing I succeeded in was amusing my daughter. It's not easy to put together at all!
0,NO WAY!!!!!,"First this review does not have to do with Pampers quality.... second, I can not believe that Amazon is selling this diapers for this price. Babies r us is much more expensive and they sell this package for 40 bucks. I do like Amazon but some items are extremely expensive.!!!!!! really really bad"
0,No match to Naparima Girls Cook book,"It's okay. I tried her recepies on basics like breads and it was bland. I think she's mixing Trini with some other culture's recepie and it's just not working too well. The way she describes ponche crema is not the simple, delicious way a Trini makes it-- We don't add cream of coconut!I should have put the money towards the Naparima Girls book. Never heard one complaint about that book from any die-hard Trini."
1,The Journey of a real Singer-Songwriter,"""The Big Night,"" is a breakthrough album for David Zollo. After a Tenure in Iowa's ""High and Lonesome,"" and a collection of solo albums each building upon the last, this album presents itself as the matured Zollo in good form. The music is the sound of Iowa, with its dirt roads and endless fields of corn. This is the sound of honky tonk Barn parties sung by a throat as scratchy as brillo pad. Check it out."
0,No Editor? Mediocre Content.,"After watching a few of the author's videos, it was obvious he knows what he is talking about. Unfortunately, the book is filled with simple grammatical errors, repeated sentences and out of order pages! Even if you overlook the printing issues, you won't find much content. The majority of the information is common sense. It hardly lives up to being a comprehensive guide. It's like they published the first draft of a basic safety lecture. The chapters might pass as blog posts but I expect a higher standard when you print a book. I am considering returning it. Hopefully, the author will write a decent second edition in the future."
1,1984 all over again?,"We is a book all about beating the system. It follows one man's life through a journal he is writing to send on the spaceship, Integral, to primitive civilizations like us. The journal writing style and many other features reminded me greatly of 1984. This is a classic book about the impossibility of a true utopia. The love story that flows through the book ads intrigue and seems to parallel 1984 in several ways as well. The reader begins to feel the author of this journal's thoughts, regrets, and inner struggles. A true classic that few have read or even heard of that I believe should be added to every need to read list."
1,IT IS INCREDIBLE,"Clay's Measure of a Man CD is wonderful. I usually buy a CD and end up skipping 3 or 4 songs everytime I listen to it, but not this one. I love every single song. Clay has an incredible voice. My 4 year old loves him too. We get in the car and he says ""Mom, please put Clay on"" and I am only too happy to do it. He is a great role model, and we need them today. And he is singing music that anyone can listen to and love, from my 4 year old to me (34) to my mother (I'd better not say). Thanks, Clay, for being real! and for sharing your beautiful voice and attitude with the world."
1,I like it so far.....,"I've only been using this product for about two weeks, but so far, so good. The wart is shrinking, so I'll continue using it for several more weeks until I'm sure that it's gone. I like the stick much better than a liquid. It's also less expensive to use than the pads."
1,Just what I was looking for,"These are just what I was looking for. I bought ""Turbo Jam"" and wanted to get their ""sculpting gloves"". However, $50 for 1 lb gloves seemed excessive to me. So, I picked these up instead. They stretch and fit fine on my wrists. I use them around my hands, while making a fist. They work great and seem durable and well made."
1,weird stuff,"Dredge is different from anyone I've heard yet. I can't Tell what this guy is singing about. By far Dredge has some of the most modern, but beautiful music out. Young musicians. you can call it emo maybe. evn if you hate emo check this album out. I bought it knowing nothing about it. Bug Eyes is fantastic, even though I have no idea what it means."
1,Nice Bed,"Seems to be a nicely designed and manufactured air bed. We've used it for guests a few times, and are pleased with it."
0,A great disservice.,"While Shaw may have been a gifted playwright, his ""Saint Joan"" did an enormous disservice to the subject: the view it presents of Joan of Arc conflicts with the historical evidence on nearly every point, echoing instead the propaganda of her enemies. In truth, her trial was orchestrated by the English and their clerical allies (and even Shaw admits that the Inquisition overturned the verdict in 1456, shortly after the English were finally driven out of Rouen); nor was Joan a ""rebel"" except in the minds of her political opponents. By dredging up this fraudulent view of La Pucelle, Shaw's play was among the first popular works to undermine the efforts of countless scholars whose research had brought a more truthful view of the issue to light. For an historically accurate version, I would recommend any book by Regine Pernoud, many of which are offered here at Amazon."
0,Weird,"I like Michael Rapaport, but this movie disappoints. The plot is flat and confusing at times, not to mention boring. I don't mind slow movies if they have a point, but this one doesn't. And he doesn't really fight evil as I expected after reading the description.. all he really ends up doing is defending himself. The part where he's locked in the bathroom all night is just plain ridiculous. I mean, obviously if someone is beat up within an inch of his life, the girl would have called 911 for him, right? And Alexandra Holden's stutter was totally unbelievable. I've liked her in other roles I've seen her in, but she does not pull this one off. Two thumbs 'WAY down on this one.Oh yes, And I agree with the reviewer who said they were glad they didn't buy this title. I feel the same way... even a penny would be too expensive for this crude film."
1,Glad I finally found it!,"I remember watching this on TV and taped it them. Somewhere along the way I lost the tape and finally found it on here. It is a FANTASTIC show!!! A must have for anyone...no caveats, just anyone who likes music!"
1,"""A great insite into this generation's future!""","The Greatest Generation is a fabulous piece of work which transports the reader back to the 1940s and then goes on to show how it's survivors went on to influence our world. Upon completion of the book I began to think, how will my generation affect the world?"

0,Flimsy...not worth the effort!,"Although, it doesn't break the bank, it is terribly disappointing. It barely stands by itself and is frustrating to both my sons, whereas all the pieces fall off or don't line up properly."
1,Read this Book!,"Absolute genius! Professor Kunich takes a look at all the nonsense swirling around human cloning, and rips the mask off of it. With brilliant clarity and insight, this book exposes the many fallacies riddling the anti-cloning movement. Most important of all, Kunich's book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that if the government bans cloning, some of our most precious civil liberties may be next. This is a book for the ages, but especially our age."
0,Ick,"I was forced to read this poor excuse for a book for English class. It was awful. I hope Steinbeck's other books are better than this. This book read like a hazy dream more than a novel, and a BORING & UNCLEAR hazy dream at that. I hope this review convinced you to spend your time on worthwile literature as opposed to this."
1,Just what I expected,I knew this would be great. He has such an awesome voice. He can make any song great. This is the best cd I have purchased in years.
1,The belt was not included,When I finally gave the costumes to the kids I noticed that the one custome of Batgirl was not complete. The belt was missing.
0,So-so,"It would have been a great family movie if it didn't have the sex scene's (they're benign for older children, but too much for the under 12 crowd). No one over 12 would call this a good movie. The script is weak and predictable; the direction is terrible."
1,Gorgeous Glass,"Cake stand is so impressive-lovely to display any type of pastry,or cake. Domed lid is high and very functional-tall enough to cover a large cake or large amount of pastry. It is versitile in the way that you can reverse the bottom and top to create a beautiful punch bowl or serving bowl for a bowl-type dessert. As a matter of fact, I was so impressed the day it came in I re-ordered 2 more-one for my mother and 1 for my aunt!! Until now we had never seen a square pedestal & dome! You will not be dissapointed with this piece."
1,"The Best ""Hound"" Ever","This audiobook is by far the best audio version of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" available today. Reader David Timson does a masterful job. Unlike certain other audio versions where the reader rushes headlong through the book, seemingly without ever pausing for breath, Mr. Timson reads with expression, timing, and style. If you want to hear this novel read the way it should be read, buy the Timson version. It is superb."
0,Watch out---New Design EXPLODES!,"Ever since they've redesigned these, almost every morning, my son is found wet, and the diaper has actually split on the sides with the gel contents spilling everywhere. It's ever so much fun having to clean a toddler, crib, walls, floor, all first thing in the morning. I have used these religiously since the first couple of months, but I've changed brands."
0,Don't waste your money,"This watchtower was never used by the manufacturer because the unit itself comes with 3 legs that could likely hold one pound of weight and this weighs several. The ""legs"" don't even lock in place, they just sit in groves so the minute you place the weight on it they collapse over and over. If you manage to get it to stand the minute your child touches it it will fall over. Otherwise it would have been a wonderful toy. It looks like the show and the body is sturdy and well put together. Too well put together to be supported by the legs provided. Don't buy it, if your child is younger talk them into the Spiderman playset, much more sturdy."
0,no!!!!,"iguess you have to be stoned to enjoy this moviebecause any other way its just bad its just not interesting ,not funny, not worth it"
1,Most important book of the 20th century,"Firstly this is a fantastic book and a fantastic read. At times brilliantly lurid and erotic and at other times completely bleek and depressing. At all times it is however engaging to the point of being one of those cant-put-down type books.Secondly this book is just as important as Hayek's Road to Serfdom. Although Hayek's treatise rightly or wrongly (and I would tend towards the latter) skewed economic thinking towards the economic rationalist line so favoured by the Friedmanites, it was 1984 that put the fear of god into people who care little for economics. It has helped shape the world that we live in today.As a side note, the final part of Simon Schama's History of Britain is a look at The Two Winstons. Namely Churchill and Orwell through the main character of this book. It is an excellent exploration of the two men and really gives an idea about who they were and what they really stood for."

0,Could've Been Good -- Too Much Talking/Lecturing,"I've done both workouts on this DVD, and I enjoyed the moves/poses; I also liked the two different workout options -- 35. min & 60 min. But, honestly, I dread using this video again because I do not want to hear all the lecturing about the environment, about forgiving people, about the ""planet's blessings,"" etc... it almost seemed like it was a lesson on how yoga was the answer to all problems. For me, that is why I go to church and why I read my Bible. I really liked the idea of using this dvd for good flexibility, etc., but I'm not up for the over-the-top lecturing over and over. This is why I find it so difficult to find a good yoga dvd. I will keep looking."
1,Stunning,"This tiny Steinbeck classic, published in 1937, is still considered one of the most stunning, impact producing works ever written. It continues to knock my socks off. And more than likely, always will. If you've never had the pleasure of reading this timeless classic, you really, really should."
0,Sophomoric at Best,"Having read only one other Higgins book before (Cold Harbor), I hesitate, somewhat, to comment on the author's general talent. However, this book has to be one of the worst I've read in some time. I think the thing that got me the most was the dialog; unbelievably simplistic and totally formulaic. ""Damn, he said to Kate, ""It's the Hazar Scouts, "" Puhleeze! Not even an exclamation mark. Many other examples could be given. Now, assuming for the moment that the dialog was, say, written at greater than a 7th grade level, the plot is almost as bad. The protagonists' reactions to their fellows getting knocked off one-by-one is almost comic. There's no depth here; just one simple vignette after another. I wouldn't even want to compare this to Ludlum or Clancy (although Clancy's gotten a bit rough of late).A terrific waste of a good"
1,Well done,"This is a very well done dramatization of the game...not that the series only encompasses the first of the three games, however it does so faithfully...they even manage to get in most of even the most unbelievable special attacks in a fun scene...I highly recommend this set for fans and newbies alike..."
1,Wow - not hating Steinbeck,"I've always made a big deal about how much I do not like Steinbeck or Hemingway, but after reading a couple of both of theirs this year, I have to admit that I LOVE both. As far as Steinbeck, I know that I still despise The Grapes of Wrath, but this is an incredible book. Especially short and easy to read, the writing is simply superb. The characters are well-developed, the dialogue is simple and to the point, and the descriptions are detailed. This book deserves it's frequent consideration as a classic. And while I still can't imagine ever liking GOW, I can no longer dismiss Steinbeck."
0,Is this the same Clay?,"Wow, this album is a HUGE disappointment.#1 This does not sound like the same Clay that we fell in love with on American Idol, He sounds like a half rate Boy George.#2 The production is awful, it sounds as if he is being backed by karaoke tracks.#3 Where is the soaring, clear and beautiful voice we know he once had?Shame on those who were in charge of letting this cd be released in this condition.It seems as if all the hype is put into the show, then all care is forgotten when it the time comes to record an album. Welcome to the real world Clay, I hope the next album supports your wonderful talent."
1,My first Temperance Brennan story - Good book!,"It was a really satisfying read. There are a lot of gruesome details...it helps that the author is a forensic anthropologist herself.I read parts of the book alone at night and made myself scared thinking someone was watching me or going to break into my apartment while I was sleeping. After numerous attempts at trying to read before bed and getting too scared to carry on after a page or two, I finally decided to stick to reading during the daytime.The only things that slowed me down with this story were the French words. I could have done without them, but I guess Reichs was trying to keep things real since part of the book took place in French-speaking Canadian cities.I really enjoyed the chemistry between Tempe and Detective Ryan. I'm anxious to see that relationship develop throughout the rest of the series which I will be reading."
1,My sick dog needed a supplement- these work !,"My miniature schnauzer (11.75 years old) has congestive heart failure, and won't eat any of the prescription dog foods. So, she gets unsalted people food (ground meats, rice, oatmeal, and various baby food fruits and veggies). I wanted to be sure she got enough of the vitamins and minerals that I can't really figure out, so got these. She won't eat them (but she won't eat anything 'dog' except Charlee Bear treats), but when I crush them and put them in applesauce, she doesn't spit them out. That's a win around here these days... :/"
1,an outstanding product,"This ""grabber"" is the best designed unit I've ever purchased, and I've had several different designs. I strongly recommend it for purchase by those having trouble stooping, bending, or reaching."
0,a terrible descent,"When I heard their first album, leitmotif, I was blown away (something that only ocassionally happens). A fascinating album, combining various instrumentals with well placed vocals. so some time went by and eventually I bought the follow up, el ceilo (sp), and to say the least it was really damn disappointing. songs were too structured, ambiant sounds were predictable and not-interesting. and the lyrics SUCKED. i was really bummed. but then I saw a new album comming out. alright, perhaps they learned from mistakes, perhaps every song won't sound over-produced and catchy. instead, it only got worse. if you had never heard this band before, ""catch without arms"" will probably sound alright. but if you knew how good they were on leifmotif, don't buy this. i feel like i wasted my money (and i rarely feel that way about music). dredg has lost whatever it was they had. they are just mediocre. a real tragedy"
0,Disappointed to say the least,"After using a different type of Pampers, we purchased these. My 10 week old premie has had numerous blow-outs in these diapers. His clothes end up wet often and they feel much cheaper material than Pampers Swaddlers. I definitely won't purchase Baby Dry diapers again!"
1,"Some Good, Some Decent, None Bad","I read this book about a month ago, and I have to say, it's... okay. There are some really good stories in it, some that really made me say, wow, who is this new guy. But then there are other stories where I wonder agin, who is this guy (but in a weirded out way). I really liked the comedy stories, The Art of Romance, and How To Make A Man Cuddle were pure genius, I literally laughed out loud. Some of the sad stories are a bit schmaltzy, but decent. The one I didn't really care for was Bunjiro. NOt that it was a bad story, I just think that he needed to make this its own seperate book. All in all I recommend this book the stories are so diverse that I feel that this author is worth a looking into. This book seems to be his way of testing the waters and testing his abilities as a writer. Would I buy a second book by him. You bet!"
1,Sturdy Bench,"I am 6'1"". This bench is a very good fit. It feels sturdy and stable when lifting. There is a good span between the uprights to ensure your hands don't hit when replacing the bar. It was easy to assemble. I have decided to remove the leg lift, but it was not in the way. The padding is comfortable and seems durable. I would definitely recommend this bench for a daily workout."
0,Leaky!!,"These leak about every other time my baby poops. I purchased them accidentally thinking I was getting the Swaddlers. Will NEVER buy these again, just terrible!!"
1,Worth Reading,"Hutton more or less aproached the book as an unbiased historian instead of going out of his way to critique Wicca. Although just stating the facts in itself makes wicca look silly. I'd recomend reading this book. As much as I dislike Wicca the history and evolution of it is interesting.Wiccas roots are in freemasonry, crowleyish occult b.s and well meaning but flawed writers like Yeats, Frazer and Graves. Once you get past where its roots lie it gets even worse. Wicca has absolutely nothing to do with true Heathenry. Its more or less a bunch of made up crap. I look at Wiccans as borderline retarded goofballs and roleplayers. I don't spend much time worrying or thinking about them, but I hate that most peoples perceptions of Celtic Heathenry comes from wiccan non sense and that they are making inroads into the Asatru community."
1,I love my TiVo,"This is the second TiVo DVR I've owned. I really like the dual tuner feature. I prefer using the TiVo DVR to the DVRs my local cable company rents. One of my favorite features is that when you fast forward or rewind, this DVR compensates for that split second it takes from the time you recognize the end of a commercial and the time you release the fast forward feature. TiVo builds in a slight ""jump back"" feature, which the Comcast's DVRs don't have. I also like the TiVo Desktop software which I've installed onto my home computer. With my home network, I can transfer shows from the DVR to my computer's hard drive."
0,Bad Product--great company. Responded immediately to problem with product.,The product was defective. Could not be cranked down. Bolts were missing from package. The company offered to replace and shipped me the missing bolts. I reccomend the company but not this jack.
1,Outstanding Wireless Adapter for Tivo,I needed this wireless adaptor because I don't have two cable outlets close enough together to reach an ethernet cable from my wireless router to my TV and cable splitters ruin my Internet connection. It did not disappoint. Once I hooked it up to my new Tivo I began running through the setup screens. The adapter easily found my network SID. The screen to enter the security key was simple to use. It quickly connected to my network with the WPA2 security after I entered my key. I was impressed how quickly it was able to download the settings and initial programming to make the Tivo and my TV usable. This is a great product and well worth the price!
1,"Get off the dead horse of ""old school"" education","To those seeking an outline of what education needs to practice so ""no child is left behind"" this book is a starting point about how people learn. The flow of the book is easy to follow and considers the research findings of how the brain learns in stages of life. Unlike those who consider brain research a ""fad"", I know from application of the knowledge in this book, the influential changes do produce positive results for students. In the world of ""accountability"" the tools of Brain Based teaching will allow students and teachers a solution in ""leveling the field"" for the students from less fortunate environments, which politicians are clueless about in regards the obstacles of ""survivalists of poverty"". I highly reccommend this book to those wishing to ""get off the dead horse"" and provide a productive environment for education in the 21st century."
1,Great stuff,"The best 'dish' on one of the best shows ever! The most interesting parts, I thought, was when reading things from the writers' perspectives... the unseen, unheralded talent behind it all. (Just an opinion.) Highly recommended.Also recommended - NO ONE'S EVEN BLEEDING and DELANO"
1,Should serve as the basis for a required course in every Seminary,Well written - fast read - thoughtful - excellent footnotes.Clearly and forcefully refutes much of the fuzzy thinking of the last fifty years.
1,Get Shirty!,"I am a guy who wears formal shirt and tie to my office, so I have lots of shirts and I know a good shirt when I wear it.This was my first purchase of a Bill Blass Dress Shirt, so I did not quite know what to expect.Well I have now worn it a few times and it has been laundered and ironed and is still holding up well.I would recommend this shirt which I bought at an excellent price in a recent Amazon sale."
0,Unsatisfying ending disappoints the reader,"The plot develops nicely then ends abruptly with an unsatisfying ending. It seems to the reader as if the author had reached her contractual page limit and slapped an ending onto the book. A superhuman villian was terminated too easily. The method of capture was not adequately developed. Several promising themes were not followed up by the author, especially the entriquing possibility that through genetic testing Gault's uncle may have been his father or the reason for the military being interested in the investigation. The author took one of the least interesting possibilites and handled it in a below average formulaic manner"
1,The One I missed,"I thought I had read everything by C.S.Lewis, and was pleasantly surprised when a friend recommended Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold. I downloaded it to my Kindle while experiencing a rainy autumn week-end in Northern Michigan. Within this excellent read the sun came out, even though the rain was still giving me a great reason to curl up in a chair and enjoy the genius of Mr. Lewis. Needless to say, I spent a very enjoyable week-end because of this wonderful novel. I thoroughly recommend it!"
0,Don't expect much,"The original was original. This was just the same, event the motorcycles were the same from the original. Come on!"
0,This was just a mistake.,"Re-releasing this series with a new illustrator was a terrible idea and, frankly, completely missing the point of the originals. The stories themselves are a collection of sleepover tales and urban legends which, when taken alone, aren't particularly frightening. For those of us who enjoy this series, it was the original illustrations from the twisted mind of Stephen Gammell that made these ""Scary Stories"" truly scary; without them, the book is laughable. Helquist may be a talented enough artist, but he can't hope to duplicate the underlying terror of Gammell's illustrations."
1,Very sexy,I'm not gay or male but I do enjoy Bob Vickery. His stories always gets my juices flowing. I will definitely read more from him.
0,Dumb adaptation that does not try to be even remotely good,"Lackluster adaptation of the vertigo comic book that is only a fraction of the original source material and puts in a actor who can't live up to the character he is trying to play. Keanu Reeves fumbles badly with his role and the rest of the cast follows suite with the lousy script that make them all look like fools. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare come out of this cinematic debacle with their heads high because they do more than the script does in this film. They give more to their respective characters than they should have and make the film a little better than it really is and that's no small feat considering the fact that Keanu and the rest of the cast do look like fools thou out the entire film thanks to the badly written script and lackluster special effects.For Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare, the film gets a four rating. The rest of the film does not even merit one."
0,Warning for customers,"Any storyteller can tell you that there's little point in telling scary stories without proper atmosphere. Scary stories are told at night around campfires or in darkness lit only by a single flashlight. When reading this book of folktales, you lose the advantage of total darkness and the timing and tone of a storyteller's voice. What made up for the lack were the strange and frightening illustrations of Stephen Gammell. This edition of the book replaces those with far tamer illustrations. Reading it now is akin to telling a scary story while sitting poolside at noon with all your buddies, there's very little impact or involvement for the reader.I hope someday that Harper Collins will bring back the illustrations that truly made these stories scary, but until then I cannot recommend this edition."
0,Not funny,I laughed a lot at the description of this book but not even once when reading the real book! All the funny parts were on the cover of the book - nothing left inside.
1,great service,"I was very pleased to purchase this product at such a great price point. It is an excellent product. But even better, the product was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. I would go back to this vendor again."
0,Doesn't even come close to fitting,"Bought it for my 17"" MacBook and it is inches too big in both dimensions. Can't use it without cutting it down and then you lose the cutouts that allow the cover to close. The company never responded to emails about returning or exchanging.A total waste of money, will never buy from this company again. Bad product and absolutely no customer support!"
1,Solid Product.,This seems to work for us. When he was nursing at night we still needed 2 diapers to get through the night. At this point with 1-0 night nursings 1 diaper generally does the trick.
0,Repeated phrases are annoying.,"This book series gets annoying. Every character in the book is a whining sissy. The author repeats a few phrases more times than I would like to read. The lack of creative writing along with the characters whining, irritates me. If you like zombie novels were everyone sits around and sobs about how pathetic and confused they are. Then this is your novel. This book is bad, but it has some good qualities. The second book (the city), however, is just more of the same and worse. I'm 100 pages into The City, and I feel like a chump for giving this publisher more of my money. In both books there has been the introduction of more than a hundred characters, and out of all of them not one is going on a zombie killing rampage.Autumn doesn't compare to other great zombie adventures like Day By Day Armageddon or Tooth and Nail.This is one story that isn't worth the time or money."
0,HORRIBLE,"This cd is horrible Madonnas verson of Eva is terrible she should not have been allowed to screw up such wonderful songs as ""Dont Cry"" and other...i dont suggest this cd to anyone who wants to hear how the songs are suppose to be sung...if you wanna hear them the right way get Elaine Paige's version or Patti LuPone...(forgive me if i spelled her name wrong)......"
1,Quality diaper!,"We've tried close to every brand of diaper available - even store brands. We've had a lot of success with Pampers diapers. Our daughter is tall for her age and has a longer torso. With some diapers it is difficult to find one that fits high enough, preventing leaks. These seem to fit her well, no leaks! Also, for as thin as they are, they seem to be very aborbent.We had been using Costco's Kirkland brand diapers because they were a good value diaper, and were not unhappy with them. However, after I enrolled in the 'Amazon Mom' program, I am able to get these diapers shipped to my door on the schedule I choose, free shipping, for less than I was able to buy the same quantity of Costco's brand. Impressive! We're able to get a quality, brand-name diaper at a big-box-store price.Since enrolling in the program, we have switched back to Pampers and are very pleased!"
1,BRAND NEW USED BOOK,I still can't believe that this is a used book. I was practically untouched. What an unbelievable product for an amazing price. Thanks again.Eddie O
1,"Great, but not much is new","Everyone else tells the details, but this really said nothing new and has little that is new. The untold plot had already been told in the movies and this only reenforces it. I personally disappointed with episode 22 with the fact that the music which really made the secene so memorable was dimmed down alot. I'm not saying this dvd is bad, I'm just saying I would think about it a little bit more on how you spend your money."
0,Needy,"She seemed to be ""ill"" when it was convenient for her. All I kept thinking about was how she should have thanked her lucky stars that she and her family could afford all that treatment.I really kind of wanted to smack her and say Snap out of it!"
1,Great performance!,"Maggie Smiths is phenomenal! Her portrayal of the lonely spinster Judith Hearne is impeccable. The scene where she drinks alone is really heartbreaking. Bob Hoskins is equally good as James Madden who broke her heart due to mutual misunderstanding. In fact, there is no bad acting in this movie. I, however, have conflicting feelings about the concluding scenes (Madden visiting Hearne at the hospital) which are not in the novel. These might be the only scenes showing clearly Madden's lonliness and really draw a balance between the two main characters. But the character of Madden is made a little too desperate for money here and somewhat contradictory to how he behaves in the rest of the movie."
0,pointless rubbish,"Just as the title says, book of nonsense. A book of poorly written rhymes, lacking even a hint of smutty humour."
1,Outstanding Bed,"I've owned 2 beds for over 2 years now and both beds have held up extremely well considering the amount of constant use they've had. One of beds I actually sleep on daily (more comfortable than my regular bed). I had it over 2 years before one of the inner baffels gave way a few weeks ago. I immediatly ordered another bed without hesitation. Very comfortable and super easy to use, with the built in pump, it's a snap to set up and deflate. Love this bed!!"
0,Review of book,"I didn't care for this book at all - in fact, I stopped reading it several times because it droned on and on about the writer's depression - so much so, it made me depressed! I wanted to read about her recovery - and after more than half of the book behind me, I was still looking for that. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone!"
1,Corn Farm Boy - Lois Lenski,"This is a wonderful book about farm life in the 1950's, written from the viewpoint of a 12 year old boy, called here Dick. He does all the things farm kids did in those days. He fakes sickness so he can be home when the new tractor drives in the lane, rides the cows, makes pets of everything, falls in the creek. His dad farms on the contour and the neighbors think he is crazy. Lois was in the habit of visiting the homes of children in whatever part of the country she wrote about, got to know the kids by staying with them a spell, and then wrote about them. I highly recommend all the Lois Lenski regional books."
0,A disapointed debut album,"I've anticipated this cd for some time and must say it is not what I had expected it to be. I thought it would contain more ballads, lite pop and broadway songs, which he performed on American Idol. This cd is very boring, everything sounds alike. Clay has great range but the music Clive Davis selected for his first cd does not show the versatility shown on American Idol. I still believe Clay is Broadway, not this run of the mill type music."
1,Great Read From Amazon,Have read this book at least 3 times. This edition is excellent if you have good eyesight. The print is very small and not very dark. I read it under a very bright light and it was fine. It would be good for a student. Good to read on a train on the way to work because it is so lightweight.
1,A well-lived life- Benjamin Franklin,"The ""Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin"" is a story of one of the most fascinating and accomplished person who ever lived. Not only was he an accomplished politician (sounds like an oxymoron- accomplished politician, anyways I digress), he was a scientist, inventor, philanthrophist, etc.One important aspect of his autobiography we can benefit from is how he was able to become a better person despite being temperamental and foolish in his youthful years. He concentrated on overcoming one character flaw such as his temper and worked on it for a month. Then, he moved on to overcome another character flaw. He made minute but measurable progress to become an accomplished and fine individual.His autobiography should be read by all. It gives a glimpse at one of our great Americans.JR FelisildaAuthor of the book, ""Nanay: Lessons From a Mother"""
1,AMAZING book,"There is very little that I can say that hasn't already been said. In short, this is the greatest book that I have ever read. It changed my life. It comes, as you might guess, VERY highly recommended."
0,Not for children to PLAY with!,"This item is not meant for children to play with! Strange, since it has to do with action figures of Super Heroes! But honestly, if your child does more than set this on a shelf, you'll soon be hearing screams of frustration. The elevator won't work! (ours completely stopped working in 2 days); The guns on the top keep falling off!; The whole thing just falls apart. No, this item is for the collector and I think Mattel KNEW that. They figured the few that were opened and did not work offset all the ones that would remain MIB or NRFB for collectors.This item is just like Mattel's HOT WHEELS JUNKIE SETS. Another sore point with parents. Hot Wheels cars are fine, but those sets that Mattel makes NEVER work as promised. And what's with the instructions that have little to no writing on them??! Some of the drawings are impossible to figure out. In Mattel's case, a word is worth a thousand illustrations!"
1,Great Movie,"I seen this movie too many times to get scared. But I enjoy it each time. I also enjoy watching the special features. The house that they filmed this movie in was really haunted. The movie crew kept seeing, feeling, and hearing things. They also talked about different haunted places in the special features. If you are into haunted movie's you don't want to pass this movie up."
1,"A GREAT story, BUT ......","I REALLY enjoyed this movie. And bringing Baal AND Apophis back was truly inspired.ONE reviewer here said that he did not understand how Daniel got his leg back. Uhhh ... DUH!! OBVIOUSLY he got himself a PROSTHETIC leg.The reason I only gave this movie 4 stars was because in other reviews on other sites, it was said that there were going to be hints about a NEW PROPOSED SG series called STARGATE: UNIVERSE.I saw NO such hints. BUT, I suppose that it could be because, last I read, SG: UNIVERSE is still up in the air as to whether it will be produced or not. I really hope it IS produced, it sounds like a very unique concept in the SG franchise."
1,Wonderful!,"Ever since AI finished I have been waiting for this album to arrive. Now that it has, it surpassed my expectations. I like every song on it. Clay's voice is amazing as always, and his song choices were right on the mark. I hope to hear many more albums from Clay in the future!"
1,Surprisingly Good=)!!,"This book was one that i wish i would of read when i was suppose to in 9th grade. It was once we reached the middle of the book i realized how good it was. I am one of those students who hate reading those long novels about nothing important. Even though my teacher said it was one of the shortest novels we would ever read! After only reading the middle to the end. I just had to check this book out for myself! Once you begin this book, you may think it starts off boring..but keep going becuase youll never want to put it down. It teackes you about loyalty and friendship in real life situations. This is a book i would read over and over again!.Try this book out..you'll really like it!"
0,An Ever expanding story followed by same ol same ol,"Very disappointing read. Starts with her tale of what she saw in 1963 then devolves into another ""MASSIVE GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY"" work. Offering no documentation to support statements made. Unsupported statements about what her boyfriend said, claimed or saw. Lauds Garrison and his persecution of an innocent man in New Orleans. Originally I thought &#65533;The Assassination tapes&#65533; By George O&#65533;Toole was the worst effort in Conspiracy volumes but no more."
1,Readable study of 1/2 the Platonic dialogs,"Guthrie covers all of the earlier Platonic dialogues in this volume, up to and including THE REPUBLIC. The next volume in the series (THE LATER PLATO AND THE ACADEMY) covers the rest. Each chapter covers one or two dialogues. Guthrie mentions work published by previous philosophers, and indicates where he agrees and disagrees. The book has a particular emphasis on the development of Plato's theory of the Forms and the influence of the Pythagoreans and Parmenides on Plato's thought. It's very reader-friendly yet packed with information. I can recommend both volumes to casual Plato fans."
1,great 4 hiking,"The ""Fours"" recently purchased are just as comfortable and supportive,right of the box-as were my two previous ""Fours"". My first pair just wore out after four years of constant hiking. Unfortunately, the second pair, after two years of Catskill hiking lost its waterproofing ability but I believe that was so because of a seam opening between the uppers and sole; it has however remained my fair-weather hiking boot. My newest""Fours"" are terrific. I had to get them in second choice,black. I'll get used to them."
1,if interested in knowledge of the buddist religion; this is a must book,from start to finish it left you with knowledge and a possible desire to get in deeper. i read the entire book in only two sessions.
0,This book could have been something special...,"It's a shame this book was so poorly written, and misleading in its title. The Java/Tomcat community has been struggling for some time with Tomcat, trying desperately to gain some sort of useful insight from the horrid online documentation. Then along comes this long-awaited manual that could have easily saved the day for thousands of sysadmins.Problem is, this book provides next to no useful information on the integration of Apache and Tomcat. It's bad enough that this information comes at nearly the end of the book. What's worse, the integration chapter is only a few pages long, and goes no further (in fact, doesn't even go as far) as the documentation that's provided online.This book is a huge disappointment - you are far better served by picking up a good O'Reilly book on servlets/JSP/etc. and figuring out the Tomcat installation/webapp deployment issues on your own."
0,not a healthy product,"I started this a week ago and within one day of taking it as directed, i developed hives and full body rash. I know the possibility of these side effects was stated, but the degree is more extreme than expected. I stopped taking it on Tuesday and it is now Friday. The incredibility itchy rash continues. Use at your own risk."
1,Great for basic MIDI understanding and Setup,"I am a student at musicians Institute in LA. I wanted to learn more about MIDI and bought this book.It has old pictures and couple sections are out of date. But if your are able to tell the difference between todays computers used in Music, you'll be fine>Great explanation. Very easy discription how MIDI messages are sent, how to use them and how to put together a MIDI System>All in all a great book. Helped me a lot"
0,Would be great but...,"The package says it goes from lower belly to just under bust. I am a short woman and it doesn't reach my ribs leaving me with two huge rolls of fat on the front and back. It takes me in great, love that about it but because it isn't long enough I can't wear it anywhere:("
0,"powerful the title, empty the content",I bought the book with a lot of expectations and I was disappointed. The author keeps on sayng trivial statements as if they were his own discovery. Not a very useful book.
1,Classic horror,"This is a horror masterpiece. I return to this movie every October. I watch it from my dark, cold, New England bedroom. On repeated viewings it's just as scary as the first time I saw it...over 20 years ago. Read the book as well; it's just as good."

0,Good ONLY for total beginner,I came away with literally nothing new from this book. If you have read many web forums or other books- this is aimed at complete newbies.I also didn't like the writing style or editing. If you know the very basics and don't want to be 'spoken' to like a 5yr old get Andy Stanford's excellent Surgical Speed Shooting.I am just not the target audience for this material.
1,An amazing book!,"If you are looking for a very practical look at how to live a life rich in many more ways than money, although money comes to people living life with a 'definite purpose' as noted in the book."
1,Clan of the Cave Bear,This book was delivered on time and in the condition advertised. I would purchase a used book again from this source.
0,Julia,"I had great hopes for this film, it was after all an Oscar winner, but I now understand why the film was not widely available. I found it disjointed. There seemed to be a lot of time spent shouting down the telephone and smoking cigaretes which would be fine if the conclusion satisfied me, it didn't.The main Character, played by Jane Fonda, seemed naive and hopeless, the title character, played by Vanessa Redgrave was such an enigma that she was unbelievable in substance and played far to minor a role in the film. The only reason that I would like to know what happened next is simply to find out if any strength of resolve would be found! I think probably not."
0,awful!!,This was typical of what happens when a talented young artist gives up ! The songs are all fluff with no substance. He just talks about getting some (Wow what a new concept) This was pure cookie cutter Music. Shame on you Kelly
0,Meh...I've had better.,"I've used lots of lip and cheek stains that have had a great result, and unfortunately this is not one of them. I gave it two stars because of the price: you are getting what you pay for. The texture is really waxy and I not as natural looking as other products. It did look okay when I first put it on, but it doesn't blend incredibly well, and rubs off within a couple hours. I'd spend some more money and get something a bit higher quality."
0,"Middle of the pack, lesser Travis, but good enuf","So the consensus is thumbs down.But, even though this isn't MacDonald's best, and even though there are indeed strong--I would say uncharacteristic--elements of misogynism in some of what Travis does to a particular woman for detective purposes, and even though the antagonist is so psychotically evil as to be unlikely to have survived past his teen years (much less prospered as a super-rich international corporate executive), and even though some of the McGee cultural observations seem pedestrian and heavy handed, it's still John D. MacDonald and Travis McGee.As one of the reviewers remarks, it may not be one of MacDonald's best--perhaps his teenage kids were acting up or protesting the war in Vietnam and his wife was verbally abusing him in that timeframe (1971)--but it is certainly memorable....For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2009"

0,"Oh god kill me now, this book is BAD.","This is my mom's account. I had the pleasure of reading this book in English this year. I can honestly say, it is the single most boring book I've EVER read. You will NEVER find someone my age that enjoys this story. It has no action! No suspense! It isn't deep! Things don't symbolize anything. If they do, then you're thinking too hard. This book is not a classic. It is the worst. I'd recommend copying a dictionary before I'd ask you to read this pile. DO NOT EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS."
1,Nice Tension Rod,It might not be the strongest but so far it has done it's job very well. It looks very nice and I am pleased. Just make sure that you dont leave it loose or it will fall on your head. Overall a nice product for the price.
1,MORE THAN LETTERS...,"I admit that I bought this album for the title track alone. After all, had that been the only good track on this CD I still would have felt that it was worth my money.But the title track is just the beginning for this fine country offering by John Michael Montgomery. I found myself listening to and enjoying every track on LETTERS FROM HOME. Montgomery's smoother-than-silk voice is one of the finest in country music today and his straight-forward approach to his music comes through in every note. You won't want to miss this one.THE HORSEMAN"
0,Bealls of Florida,"The shirt fits well, good style, good shirt. But Bealls of Florida sucks as a retailer. Their customer service is rude, crude, and unrefined. Even the supervisors of Customer Service suck, they don't return or accept any items back. So BEWARE, you better be damn sure that size fits (ordered product before). Because Bealls of Florida will not let you return the item for different size or style. I will not shop here again! I repeat, I WILL NOT SHOP HERE AGAIN. THIS PLACE SUCKS AS FAR AS A RETAILER."
1,Altogether an enjoyable movie,"All in all, I have to say that I enjoy this movie very much. I first saw it when I was very young (right after it came out) and it got to me just as much then as it does now.I will admit however that to a person who isn't into the UFO phenomena it might not make a lot of sense. Being very big into the paranormal myself (practically my whole life), I will say that it even took me a while to fully understand what was going on in this movie. Ultimately however at the end there isn't much that can or can't be proven as no one can really claim to know the full truth (at least that I know of :)).Altogether I give this a 4 out of 5 stars. If you're into the UFO phenomenon, you'll probably enjoy it. If you're not, it's still a fun movie to sit down to on a friday night with some popcorn and have a few thrills."
1,"Fun, well directed Batman film","What a great cast... Christian Bale, Tom Wilkinson, Cilian Murphy, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and the greatest living actor today... Gary Oldman. What more could you ask for?This movie introduces the beginning of Batman, as well as introduce two new villains from the Batman live-action franchise - Scarecrow and Ra's al Ghul. It has a wonderful mix of comedy, drama, and action, as well as a very nice ending. Gotham never looked as beautifully depicted as Nolan has done. You won't be disappointed with this movie."

1,This player deserves more US air time,"I fell in love with Brasilian jazz my first trip to Rio. I've been there many times and was always amazed, visiting the little clubs, listening to a lot of great players. I don't remember how I found this guy, but, understanding music 'from the heart', Leo understands, and plays it that way. In my view, he is one of the most sensitive sax players I've ever heard - check out #3 on Black Pearls, you'll see what I mean..... I think it would be a great project for Leo to hook up with Bob James and Fourplay, and let Leo play, I mean feature him, write and produce songs that bring out his talent, give him lots of freedom. I rated this 4 stars, simply because of a couple of songs I skip pver, but all in all, it's great listening. And as a bassplayer, I've spent hours playing along with him."
0,Warning - This Movie is Pan & Scan,totally unacceptable. I would not buy this movie until they come out with a version with the Original Aspect Ratio.
0,Disappointing,"This book was very disappointing, by the title you would think that this book has useful information about the different religions and how homosexuality plays a part in that religion. I could only force myself to read half of this book before I got sick of the author constantly talking about homosexuality as humiliating and ridiculous. Having researched Native American tradition and Wicca I have come to know that neither of these traditions look down on homosexuality as being humiliation or ridiculous. This book is not at all what it appears to be."
0,For Simpsons fans.,"If you like the television series ""The Simpsons,"" you will probably like Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. They reflect the same vulgar approach to entertainment which, instead of making us rise above the gutter of everyday life, brings us to the lowest level of crudity. There are some redeeming tales however, such as the Knight's Tale, but as a whole, this book should be avoided by anyone with a sense of honour and decency."

0,"Interesting methodology, Uninteresting result","As others have commented, the dreary humdrum of ""Last Days"" feels more authentic (and sad) than a typical Hollywood rendering of the same. I suppose there is art in the sheer guts to make a portrayal so bleak, so real. But having said that, to want to invest 90 minutes of one's time in such a story, one has to actually care about the protagonists. In this case, there isn't any set-up, no reason to care. In fact, I found myself actively disliking, even loathing the characters (all of them). When the end came, I just didn't care anymore. If this were really what Cobain became like, then his death wasn't a tragedy. It was a blessing.Postscript: it would be nice to see van Sant make a movie that identifies with real human beings rather than the drugged characatures of Last Days or My Own Private Idaho. Those folks . . . just let them die. We don't need them here."
1,Great Diapers,These diapers hold so much liquid! Not that I like to let my baby soak in a wet diaper for hours on end but I'm still amazed at the weight of the thing when I pull it off after he's slept in it all night! They have leaked from time to time but only if I neglect to untuck the gathers around the legs or if he falls asleep sooner than usual (I won't wake him up to change his diaper when this happens so sometimes he goes longer in a diaper than usual).

1,This Stuff Works,"Most OTC wart removal products from your drug store are 17% salicylic acid (the active agent). This is 40% and the difference is noticable.You do need patience. I put a generous dab on my wart(s), daily if I can remember, and then cover with a band aid to prevent my clothes from rubbing it off. Some warts take a week or so before falling off and some much longer. I am just rid of one which took over a month. Did I mention you need patience?I suspect the OTC stuff would work too; it would just take a *lot* longer."

0,Really bad....,"This is by far the worst movie in black cinema. Take everything you liked about ""Friday"", ""Booty Call"" and ""CB4"", leave them out of this movie and this is what you get. 90 minutes of [stuff]. It is low budget beyond low budget, and you get a headache from listing to fake, incoherent characters who look like they were picked off the street of some ghetto. And those who like to see booty-there is basically none, just one scene which lasts about 15 seconds and features a silent, unattractive ""dancer"".. If you are a fan of these movies, rent it first, you'll see. If you buy it, you will find a movie devoid of beautifull black women and good looking guys, but which is filled with stupid humor and a story which will put you to sleep."

His prediction of the future was a little to far fetched for me. That book wasnt really my style. I can see this book being liked by many people so I would recommend it due to the fact everyone has different opinions. This book being such a negative outlook of the future just wasnt what i wanted to read about.
0,It deviated a lot from the book,"Really, the title of my review is my review. The movie deviated a lot from the book and being a lover of Narnia, that was very disappointing to me. I hate what they did to Peter's character, I was annoyed by the added ""love interest"" and most importantly, Aslan was often left out. I love in the book the picture of faith and trust with Lucy having to decide whether to follow Aslan even when noone else believed her that he was there. That was not fully addressed in the movie - I suppose cut in leu of more battle scenes and false tension between Peter and Caspian. sigh. A very pretty movie though - I loved the river god - just sadly altered."
1,The Dead Kennedys of our generation?,"It might just be! That means a hell of alot too. It's a shame that that this band is labled 'nu-metal', becuase honestly, this is the most punk rock thing I've heard in a while. Hell, even the singer makes me think of good ol' Jello. I'm not a big fan of radio suppourt but this band diserves it. Some of the best lyrics in mainstream rock.Thumbs up"
0,Not a good read,"I am sorry to say, but this book was without a doubt, one of the wrost books I have ever read in my life. The story dose have plot but that is about all the good things that go along with the story. I also did enjoy how Verne made up basic human needs from using marine and plant life from the sea. The last thing that was good, was when the crew of the Natulius had to fight the giant squid, they are called something else in the book, but I didn't pay attention. Those are the ONLY good factors about this book. The author spends more time on description of the water than the action of the book. I found that very dull and boring. When I first read the book, I had heard great things about it, but when I read the book, I was very disspointed. Take my advise, don't read the book."
0,Simply the worse book ever.,I had to read this book for my high school English class. I hated every bit of it actually I never finished it. This book does not belong on the list of classic must reads. As a college student now I thought I would give the book a second chance just as something to read for my own personal joy of reading. This is still to this day the WORSE book I have ever read in my life!! How could anyone actually like this back enough to rate it 3 star much less 5. This should be rated in negative stars.
0,No theory what so ever,"The authors seem unaware of the fact that theory guides our understanding. There are no ""objective"" facts, yet the authors present all their findings as such with almost no reasoning attached. This is both arrogant and ignorant. The authors display no grasp of theoretical advances in Accounting and I recommend getting a book that has a better exposition of principles as more than practice"
1,better than Decameron,"To acknowledge the mastery of Chaucer you 've got to read ""Decameron"" by Boccaccio and ""The Consolation of Philosophy"" by Boethius.Read them and send me news on the online-review. ."
0,Might make a good coaster,I went to see this in the theater and myself and two friends could not go the distance. We walked out before it was over. The plot is ridiculous and the acting does not make up for it.
0,"the ""black sheep"" of the catalog...","if you asked Queen fans in the States the reason for the band's decline in popularity here, alot of 'em will cite Hot Space as the reason...the band did lose more than a few long-time fans with this one, and in fact the tour for the album would ultimately be Queen's last in the USA. Many of the tracks aren't bad per se, but often they're experimental to a fault...and in many instances, the ""human"" element is upstaged by synths & beats. With the exception of a handful of tunes, Hot Space is a far cry from the days when Queen proudly boasted ""No Synthesizers!"" on their albums. I might recommend this for completists, but first-timers should probably avoid this for now. However, if you want to hear proper versions of these songs, check out Queen's Live At The Bowl CD or DVD...""Staying Power"", ""Action This Day"" and ""Back Chat"" are actually powerful in raw form, unlike the techno vibe in the studio."
1,People...,"The Plug-In PET is not coming to America. The season of NT Warrior is already over, Axess is airing now. They would have brought the Plug-In to America before the Adanced PET. It wouldn't make sense to make the Advanced PET while NT Warrior is showing, then make the Plug-In while Axess is.The Plug-In is extremely rare. I have one, don't buy it. The battle system is terrible, and the battery dosn't last that long.Either buy this PET, or buy the Progress. I have both. The Progress is the best out of all..."
1,Good 18th Century Novel,"The Vicar of Wakefield is a good book that shows how a family overcomes one harship after another. It is funny and at times very witty. Even though the language is a bit old fashioned, the book is still fun to read."
0,Quality surprisingly bad,"I am really disappointed with the quality of this 2 CD set. Plus, I wasn't able to find a track list anywhere, and I was missing a LOT of songs I was looking forward to having."
0,Not worth the $2 rental,"Ok, might be worth it to learn how not to make a training video. Gary spends the whole 60 minutes in front of a green screen used as a backdrop for the whole show, talking to the camera. He does spend 15 minutes or so setting up a steadicam, dropping the monitor half way through (comical value). That's about the only practical demonstration he does. The video suffers from lack of use of the very media it's trying to teach."
0,Cheap Quality,"Not as described, the material is cheap looking and does not feel soft on the skin. Was dissapointed of the quality and packaging."
0,More of a personal opinion than that of economics,"When I read something I like the whole story with some facts to back them up, but what I got out of this book was a guy with one side of politics while giving his opinion. Although many of his policies I tend to agree with, I just have a really hard time reading something when the entire book (well, I only got around a third way through it) is swung in one way direction. If you like reading about someone's opinion then you'll love this book, but if you're like me and just like cold hard facts leaving it up to yourself at making your own opinion, then don't buy this book."
0,Defective Product,The product was delivered on time. When I inspected the bench I noticed one of the Upright Stanchions had improperly drilled holes to connect the Upright Cross Bar. Thus the bench was unusable. Called customer service for Phoenix health and Fitness INC. Hopefully they will be able to remedy the situations. Until then I just wasted my money.
0,Better books out there,Nancy Cobb has some other books out there that I found to be much better than this product.
0,I WANT MY ORIGINAL PICTURES!!!,"I mean, come on. The pictures in the original 1973 version of the book were beautiful, it was, like in many childrens' stories, half of the enjoyment. But no...buy the original somewhere else. They've just messed an otherwise great book up."
1,These do a good job at an excellent price.,"If you can combine any coupon listed on the product page (occasionally offered) with subscribe and save, these Amazon diaper deals are excellent. These pampers have done a fine job for our little one and I have no complaints. We have used cloth, but with the recently larger and more frequent poopin going on the last few months, with the addition of more baby food, these diapers make things easier for me. The other benefit, of course, is they soak up more of the liquid stuff as well."
1,The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin,Nicely done with good history and anecdotes. A way to find out about the workings of the man and his times.
1,Fun Lola Fun,"The plot is simple: Lola's boyfriend Manny gets dropped in the grease when he loses a fortune that belongs to a gang of thugs. Of course, they want to kill him. Of course, he knows his cool and devoted girlfriend, Lola, will figure out a way to get ahold of the money. And of course, she realistically doesn't have enough time to do it.What to do? Get the cash from Rich Banker Daddy? Steal the money? Win it?This is a Euro-slick film, shot like a music video. It asks, ""So she failed that time...but what if she tried it ANOTHER way?"" The audience follows Lola as she chases down the money...she does it again and again.Even though Manny is no choirboy, and Lola is not exactly Mother Teresa, you cheer for her and urge her on as the action speeds up. I liked Lola because she faces the problem head-on and then does what she's gotta do. The movie is a pleasure to watch, with none of the heavy-handed angst European films so often get slammed for."
1,Fabulous acting & soundtrack...you must see this movie!,"I saw this movie this summer, and I was absolutely blown away. Not only is the acting fantastic (especially by Franka Potente) but the subject matter was enthralling. Think ""Sliding Doors"" with an overdose of adrenaline. The concept of the movie (how would life be different if I hadn't run into that person?) encouraged hours of discussion among my friends. Besides the intellectual part, this movie is highly entertaining and there isn't enough dialogue for the subtitles to detract from the action. A must-see!"
1,Very good,"I ordered 2 sets of samples. Everything came in time, & I was very pleased. The seller even included a ton of free extras too, which I was very happy about :]. The products themselves are 'pretty good'. I recommend the shampoo/conditioner & the foaming face wash [my favorite]. Overall, a very good seller. I'll probably be buying the foaming face wash which was amazing, but everything else was just average. The eye moister jell was also very good too."
0,WACK,"This cd should be burned. any record from no limit should be, they can't rap at all. if you want real rap, listen to talib kweli, chino xl, big L, mos def, etc."

0,Endorsed by Edwin Meese and George W. Bush,"As to be expected of a book endorsed by Edwin Meese and George Bush, this book talks about how to permit right wing fascism by undermining the balance of power afforded by the Judicial Branch. Phyllis is in her typical form, blasting judges for such things as ending segregation and protecting human rights. Like another reviewer said, past the title there is nothing new. If you want to see where people like Reverend Pat Mahoney, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell get their ideas of how to destroy this country by breaking down the balance of power so that they can build a murderous Theocracy, this book is for you."
0,on website it says twin but actual size is single.,i dont know why these guys are trying to cheat. i paid full amount and i was expected to receive a twin size airbed but when i opened it it is actual size is single sized matress! so this company is baad! will never suggest it to someone.
0,I only gave it a star because I had to.,"This was the worst book I ever read. I was lost and confused and that was only in the first sentence. You would think that classic had to have some level of goodness, but this book was the worst piece of filth I had ever read in my entire life. It's no wonder that Hawthorn locked himself in his mothers attic, he was mentally ill before he ever wrote the book. If you are a high school student,like I am, you know the hell that I had to go through and I am guessing you never want to put yourself through it again. And to you who have no read this book, don't. You have not, or never will commit enough sin to be put in to the type of hell that this book offers the reader. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Oh, and by the way who decided that this was a classic romantic book, there is nothing romantic about this novel, nor anything good. If you are in the mood for a good romance shoot for Nora Roberts or Sandra Brown, they can actually write!"
1,Therapy Ball,After a serious fall I had balance problems and use of this ball to help work on my balance was recommended. It was easy to inflate and maintains inflation well. I know it has lots of other uses in body work and I would recommend it for its sturdy construction.
1,One Tree Hill,Anyone can get into this show. For all ages. It's very addicting and i wish it never ended. Worst part is Chad leaving
1,THIS CD JUST PLAINLY ROX!,"This CD is the bomb. GET IT! It's much more organized than the first. Garbage is unique, compared to other bands. I love this CD. It is my life. HELP I""M A SHIRLEY MANSON WANNABE! I love you garbage!! I'm telling you guys, if you don't get this, you are missing out on SOOOO much!GET IT!"
0,The One Redeeming Feature of This Piece of Tripe.,"What a pathetic, degrading waste of talent on the part of actor Bela Lugosi, cast ludicrously in what comes close to equaling such bottom-of-the-barrel schlock as BRIDE OF THE MONSTER. And yet...and yet......if you love Lugosi's mellifluous, Hungarian-accented intonations (as I do), just sit back and ignore (or ""enjoy"") the film's imbecilic dialogue, implausible plot, stilted acting, and utterly hilarious direction, and allow yourself to be carried away by the erstwhile treasured voice that gave Bela Lugosi the fame and stature he so rightfully deserved back in the 30s from such memorable films as THE RAVEN, THE BLACK CAT, THE INVISIBLE RAY, SON OF FRANKENSTEIN and, of course, DRACULA."
1,Mad Max is Cult Classic,"How can you not love this cheesy low-budget film from down under? Mel is great as Max, whose family is killed by a nomadic biker gang. The heartless and stone cold Max sets out bent on revenge, hence ""Mad"" Max. Violence is as plentiful as the high-octane chase scenes."
0,a refund please,"If you want a book that's based on religion, not psychology and practical ways to deal with your anger (as I was expecting), then this book may be for you. If, like me, you want a book that deals with anger from a psychological/behavioural stand point, then look elsewhere, as (like me), you may be angered by all the biblical /God/Lord references in this book and find it better suited to kindling or the recycle bin....time for me to go find a 'real' book on this topic now...."
1,Close to Parallels,"If you like the Parallels cd, then you will probably like this one too. Inside Out contains songs that, I think, could have easily been included on the Parallels disc, released three years previous. The production on this disc is kind of lacking in bass and depth, but the songs are just as beautiful as those on Parallels."
1,Textbook,"Should have been a nationwide elementary school textbook for the past 60 years.Upon reading this book, and knowing your fellow Americans will have, one couldn'timagine the losses of freedom that we are experiencing now. An absolute must read."
1,AMAZZZZIIIING QUALITY!!,"This is the reason for HD TV's to exist, to watch a movie like this with higher quality and sound that a theater. Just great, buy it if you are a fan, buy it if you love movies, buy it if you love HD, buy it if you have a TV and a couple of hours to enjoy a good action movie."
0,Questionable quality,"The teas are good, don't get me wrong, but the whole reason I purchased this for my wife was because of the box. And the quality of the box is mediocre at best. The corners were worn and the gold trim paint was splattered all over the top of the thing. Yikes!"
0,The Hound of the Baskervilles,"This is a classic mystery by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Unfortunately, this free version lacks several sections vital to solving the mystery. I have only read a couple chapters and have already found that the legend of the Baskervilles, the account of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville and a letter to Sir Henry Baskerville are missing. These omissions render this version useless, and force me to delete it from my library."
0,"Ehhh , nice visuals?","I read the book prior to wathching the film. I can only say that I was extremely dissapointed in this film.Not only did the movie insult Shirley Jackson's classic book, but also made fools of the great actors in the movie. By me saying that the movie made fools of the actors, I mean look at them , Liam neeson, Lili Taylor and Cathrine Zeta Jones , theyre all very talented but all you can do is laugh at them in this movie because the script is terrible and also very over exagerated.Donnot be fooled by this movies name. The occurances of ""hauntings"" in this movie look like they came out of a disney movie.Now the only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has great visual effects, and does make you say wow when you see the house itself.So think of this movie as disneys rendition of Shirly Jacksons book. And if youd like to see what her book is really about rent the original 1963 classic with Julie Harris and Claire Bloom."
0,Good Fun?,"This is a fun movie if you like the romantic comedy.Why 1 star?? There is a scene where an old woman calls ayoung German couple ""facists"". The irony is, the old lady is Italian. Whoever wrote the scene doesn't own I history book Iguess. That's a little on the predjudice side for me and it didn't belong in a comedy. I'm glad the couple weren't African-American, I wonder what she would have called them.Don't support this garbage by buying it, loan it from your library."
1,Great Work,"I have fallen in love with this music! The material is amazing though ""Be not nobody"" had its own magic that held the album together, this new record sounds different but different isnt always bad well at least not in this case. Her vocals seem to have improved but her lyrics remain as beautiful as ever though her boyfriend stephen should be given some credit he doesn't deserve the grammy's i know shell win for her amazing new work."
1,The tale of an Island culture...,"Mr. Philbrick tells a great story about a tragedy in the Pacific Ocean, the tragedy that inspired Herman Mellville to write Moby Dick. But he does more than tell of a ship smashed by a whale and the unfortunate survivors, he tells how they got to be months of sailing from home, out in the middle of the ocean hunting one of the largest mammals on the planet. That is the story of Nantucket and how it became the island that dominated the whale oil trade, about their customs and culture that allowed them to surpass many larger and better situated communities. It is an impressive tale and well worth reading."
0,My first young readers book,"I found the book interesting. However, tapping on the screen continually so that I could read the print and then tapping again to see the illustrations was very annoying. Also there is a page in the middle where the sentence doesn't end but the next page begins a whole new sentence."
1,Perfect!,I found that this was very helpful learning material for young preschool aged children...you won't be disappointed in this product!!
1,Pulling is Over,"A must for a determined puller, not for the dog but us owners! Near instantaneous better walking. Buddy still needs it after about three weeks. I thought he would get the idea and then I could stop using it. Not true yet and maybe never, which will not be so bad. A little bit of a pain to put on when he wants to go for a walk. Also, he has already chewed the plastic clasp and I had to buy another. His bad allowed by my not making sure it was up and away while we were out. Buddy is a puppy that requires training. Holt is a well thought out product that is effective. I recommend it."
0,A disapointing stumble,"I had looked forward to this book, as I enjoyed ""The Romanov Prophecy"" as a fun summer read. Unfortunately, Berry's allowed his religious and social views to turn his latest book into a screed. The hero's antagonist is a cardinal that believes in priestly celibacy and other traditional Catholic dogma, which makes him not merely wrong-headed but a scheming, blackmailing, cartoon villain who does everything but twirl his mustache as he ties the heroine to railroad tracks. The ""secret"" that Barry's concocted is intended to be ""provocative"" in the model of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" but instead the revelation manages to be both hilarious and (there's no other word for it) blasphemous at once. Save your time and your money."
0,Truly disappointing,"This was a truly disappointing movie. How could anyone take Liam Neeson and Catherine Zeta-Jones, add great special effects, and end up with a boring movie? Just awful."
0,Problems printing in color after about a month of use,"Things I like: wireless printing to Mac and PC, scanning, and copying. My paper never jammed. I bought this printer and used it for about a month before the color stopped working. I called support numerous times and it was a time-consuming endeavor. Each time, we would get the printer working only to have the color stop working a couple of days later. Due to the time it took to work with support and my busy schedule, I was unable to stay on top of it before my warrantee ran out...maybe that is the HP plan? Anyway, not only does the color not work, but if I don't set the documents to ""black only"", it will print blank space where the colors were. Very annoying. I also do not like how HP software installs all sorts of ""helpful"" stuff that pops up all the time. The only way I could see to avoid that was to only install the driver, but then I couldn't use the scanner."
1,"Interesting, fun and enjoyable.","I discovered this album while exploring music by Mannheim Steamroller and bought it because I am a fan of Mason Williams' ""Classical Gas."" An energetic electronic update to the original acoustic is the first performance on the album, and in my opinion ""Classical Gas 2005"" is every bit as interesting and fun as the original. The remainder of the album varies from hauntingly beautiful (Riding the Low Moon), to epic (The Last Crusade), to western-like (Eddie I'm Ready), to just plain electronic fun (Doot-Doot). The music on this album is too interesting to fade into the background. I find myself being called to stop and listen to its magic. Mason Williams and guitarist Zoe McCulloch make a great team. I'm impressed and pleased with my purchase."
0,Doesn't even deserve 1 star.,My son received this for his birthday and couldn't wait to use it. It was hard to operate and stopped working after one hour. Don't waste your money.
0,Discovery Atlas: Italy Revealed [HD DVD],I received this HD DVD twice. Both were defective as neither would even boot.
1,as good as advertised,"Yes, these boots are comfortable. They soften after a few miles of walking. They keep your feet warm and dry, especially with my smartwool socks. Order your normal shoe size, they will be just right with medium weight socks. I won't wear these around the house, running shoes are more comfortable. These will be for hiking, their intended purpose, which they do well. These were the best value that I could find anywhere."
1,Really good and even interesting for adult viewing.....,My 5 yo got hooked on the Olsens by watching reruns of Full House on Nick and ABCFam. So I got a couple of videos for her to span the divide between her Dora years and whatever comes next! This is really a cute movie that even I enjoy watching several times over. I can relate to the parental roles and she can relate to the soccer and girly stuff. This led me to make more purchases of the video series and I hope the rest are as good. A nice relaxing watch!!
1,DDR is cooool!,"This cd is really great.BUT ITS NOT A GAME!they're not long versons though, only 90 odd seconds each.If that Claire, also from the UK (who was disappointed with the cd) wants to get in touch, i know where you can get games with the songs you want.I'm assuming you're after all the cool songs from euromix.If so, they are on 2nd and 3rd mix games from japan.but there are also US versions available too."
1,Great CD!,"I think that this is a great album. My personal favorite song on it is ""Like I Love You."" Probably the most popular song on it is ""Takes a little time."" My friend is crazy about that song! You should buy this CD!"
1,Awesome Business English Book!!!,"I used this text for an online class and it was just an exceptional experience. I also had the option of visiting the classroom, which was completely out of the picture once I started turning the pages. The chapters were clear and passages easy to follow. The grammar/mechanics handbook section was really great. I have decided to keep this book as a wonderful reference tool. I find myself using it daily to double check certain things for clarification before mailing. I highly recommend this book for anyone seeking a refresher course or an improvement tool for business English. This is money well spent and is worth every cent!Other books to read for relaxation: Trilogy Moments for the Mind, Body and Soul; Everyday Miracles; and, The Language of Poetry Forms."
1,Step into Ancient Greece,"This is the best series of books I have found for history for 9-12 year olds. I teach 4th and 5th graders and they love these books. They have interesting pictures and are written at the perfect level. I like all the art project ideas they include, the organized method in which they are written, and the timeline which runs the bottom of the pages. This is a great resource. I can't recommend it highly enough."
0,This book is boring!,"This book doesn't deserve a maximum of 1,000 words! It is pointless and inconsistent. Don't read it! How could our society ever become one not dependent on books for knowledge and wisdom?"
1,It will become a part of you...,"Sweet Dream Baby is an amazing novel, and its power grows as time passes. I read the novel when it first came out, and it's still with me. The music, the sight of a swimming hole, even a dusty road can make Travis and Delia appear for me again. What I wanted to know when I put the book down was, does Travis have a chance at a decent life? And what was up with Delia? More and more, I want to find out, because I can't let these characters go. I hope there will be a sequel."
0,They just keep milking the old stuff,With 100s of unreleased tapes in the archives all Universal can do is re-hash old stuff again and againThe CDs are classic Allmans but why a box set ???
1,A Wonderful Composition,"Cummins invites the reader into her family as you take part in each event. She continues with a chronologic order of each happening as you take part by reading the in-depth view of all events, each persons thoughts and the unfortunate truth. This book gives us the knowledge and makes us aware of the tragedy that can happen in any family. Cummins reminds us that a family is ONE, no matter what occurrences take place in life. As a Gaithersburg resident, Volunteer Fire/Rescue worker and a friend of the Cummins family, I encourage all to revisit in the family's heartbreaking tragedy and uplifting story."
0,What a Disappointment,"A few helpful hints among 160 pages of wasted space. Not a solution in the book. Nice pictures, but not practical for the family looking for storage and orgainzation ideas. Even the choice of font and layout make this one difficult to read. If you are looking for a practical home orgainization book (I was looking for a home office organization book), skip this one."
0,Very easy to solve!,"This puzzle is very easy to solve, I would not recommend it for anyone. Buy the ""original"" ""Don't Break the Bottle"", it will keep you entertained much longer."
1,Pretty good.,"This warmer keeps my coffee warm, but not as warm as I would like. The unit slides away from you as you push at the on-off switch. This annoyance was overcome with some automobile trim mounting tape. 3M Company 1/2X5 Molding Tape 03609Na Automotive Tape A small square of this double-sided foam tape under each foot will hold it in one place on your desk or table. I bought the Mr. Coffee warmer to replace a homemade warmer that was better at keeping the coffee hot, but finally succumbed to old age. That warmer was made by cutting off the top half of an old 4-cup brewer and using the bottom half (warming plate and switch) as a mug warmer."
1,Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump,"I looked around before buying an airbed. Saw many options and compare. Many different comments that confused me. But decided to buy this one due to the price and the electric pump. Excellente product, inflates in just 2-3 minutes and last all night long. Easy to store in the morning. 5 star product."
1,ended too soon,"Thomas Hardy is a gloomy writer, he likes to end his books by killing off the main characters. In this story he follows the life of a man who good and bad choices in life. You frist meet him as a young married man with a drinking problem. This results in him losing his wife and set him on a path of soberity. Do it yourself AA. When then rejoin his life 20 some years later and watch him self destruct and his wife and daughter reenter his life and he doesn't know how to react. He resumes drinking, Loses his lover, get into a love hate relationship with his presumed daughter. and finally dies of a broken heart as he realizes everything he's lost because of his impulsive behavior. Interesting read."
0,Not worth your money!!,I bought this product according to the good reviews and its not worth your time and money. The product feels like putting a piece of cheap tape and nothing coming out. Dont buy this product!! Its very cheap!!
1,leet product,This thing can pick up signals better than anything I have used. It gets a better signal than the Linksys or Buffalo router functioning as a wireless bridge (via DD-WRT or Tomato). Installation is just like any other windows device. Extremely stable connection even with crappy routers.
0,Worst Toy Ever = Batman Animated Batcave,"Do not buy this toy. If you are given this toy as a gift, return it for store credit. This is a flimsly and poorly designed stack of platic and paper. The secret door doesn't work, the elevator doesn't slide and toys get stuck in there. The suggested 10"" batman doesn't work with the zip line, bungee or even the elevator. The add says ""Using new adhesive technology, you can set up the Batcave on just about any wall"" so they want us to glue this thing on to a wall.Please don't buy this toy."
1,excellent vendor,eargels replaced old and lost ones that came with my blue tooth. they fit well and got ere quicker than expected.
1,Perfect size,It's the perfect size for a single serve. It was also very cheap and I recommend this to people who only make 1 or maybe 2 lattes at a time.
1,Couldn't Be Better!,"Having never heard of this band before, I picked up this album from a Border's Bookshop store where I could sample the tunes first. Upon first sampling I thought it was interesting and fresh; I hadn't really heard a lot of music like this before. Upon repeated listenings, layers upon layers of new musical discoveries started trickling out of my loudspeakers. I was dumbfounded! To this day, Oui is one of the few albums I have that I can put on any time of day and enjoy thoroughly without reservation - I cannot say this of very many albums that I have. I cannot praise this album enough, if I could give it 10 stars, I would. The reason is that it sounds great; the album is quirky yet very accessible; the vocals are so different, yet once they get in your head you can't get enough of them and you wouldn't want them to be anything other than what they are; the arrnagements are fabulous and the compositions inventive and refreshing. I cannot recomment this album more highly!"
0,Disappointing - stick with the 1st movie,"I purchased this for my 11 year old son for Christmas. He has the first movie and has watched it numerous times. After we watched this movie I asked how he liked it. His response was same as mine. We give this a D rating, at best, a C. I have a feeling he won't be watching this over and over again."
1,One of the best books I have ever read,"I absolutely adored this novel. I first read it when I was in sixth grade and have since re-read it many times over. I felt for every single one of the characters -- even those who were less than desirable. No one character was truly evil nor was any one character truly good. Each developed and matured realistically as to their own personal phyche. By the time I turned the last page page I felt as if these characters had really lived and breathed. I must also say that the ending haunted me longer than any other book I have read. The same can not be said for the next couple of books. The second started off pretty well but then degraded itself by becoming nothing more than a romance novel. The other two quickly followed suite. Other than using them as a sex manual, I can see little value in them. I still care for Ayla and the Clan to want to know what happens next but I will probably wait until the paperback issues of her next two novels."
0,bye bye mom and dad,"My children and I love the little Critter books. This is a great book, but it was not bound well. The book fell out of the cover within a few days of recieving it."
1,Good book if you look into it.,"The Scarlet Letter is not a dull book if you get into it. It is true that it's language can be hard to read and understand at times, but that does not make it uninteresting. The main story, may not be considered exciting, but the novel is full of literary elements that make it a good book. Several faults are pointed to in this ""perfect"" Puritain town in which the story takes place. The book uses good elements like foreshadowing, foil characters, and a lot symbolism. A main point of the book is Hester's admiting her guilt as compared to her ""lover's"" hiding his guilt. I'm not going to tell you who she had the affair with, but it will be soon figuared out when you see the signs of his scarlet letter. The book may not be as exciting as some, but don't let this keep you from reading it, because it really is good."
1,Love this Pillow,I went to a Hilton and slept on the most comfortable pillow and then bought it. I love the softness of the down with the firmness of the foam that also keeps the quills from poking me in the head.
0,Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres,"This edition of 'Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres' was unsatisfactory to me.The book's preface (a lead-in to the first chapter) was entirely omitted. The book had no index. The table of contents had no chapter titles. I was giving it as a gift and had to create them myself. These post-modern facsimile editions need such things. My recent purchase of another of Henry Adams' books, Chapters of Erie, has such essential supportive material and was totally satisfactory. If it is omitted, your promotional listing should say so."
1,Easy to install...cheaper than buying directly from Dell!,"This card is a breeze to install, fits right into the slot in my Dell PC. Dell was asking for $50 for pretty much the same card, preinstalled. Saved a bundle. Couldn't be happier. No issues with Windows, no problems with connection speed. Certainly recommend this product."
0,A peculiarity from Poverty Row.,"The oddities of this Monogram semi-horror film begin with the title! The ""ghost"" in question is NOT invisible, and is not really a ghost. Also, the shadow of an ape appears on the main title card. (Don't ask me, I'm only the reviewer.) The various plot twists contain no supernatural or science fiction elements, and yet are even less plausible than those of other Monogram horrors. The director, Joseph Lewis, displays almost none of the talent he showed in his later films. Only the presence of Bela Lugosi makes this one worthwhile. The role of ""Dr. Kessler"" is a Jekyll/Hyde character, so Lugosi is playing a normal, likeable guy during most of his screen time, which makes this one of his more unusual roles. Also, Clarence Muse is good as the butler."
1,Wonderful. A thorough reference guide.,"I needed a comprehensive, intelligent guide covering HTML, DHTML, CSS etc. This book provides that and more in a easy to understand manner, that isn't too simplistic for an advanced web author. A smart layout, and nice index helps you locate what you need fast. Color charts, CSS style references, tag attributes a-plenty, DHTML overviews and in-depth information is there when you need it. If you're looking to spend on a clever guide to take you into the ever expanding world of web technologies, this book is a excellent resource!"
1,another fabulous book,"I asked for this book for Christmas and ended up staying up all night reading it straight through like a novel (porno actually) And I had made 4 peanut butter tarts before New Years. This book will join The Cake Bible as the only book I need to maintain my reputation as a serious baker. Very detailed and sometimes time consuming recipes, but they always work, and they always meet with rave reviews! Plus its just SO PRETTY!!!"
1,Amazing movie,This is a really good movie. It's divided in two DVD. It keeps your attention until the end. I'd recommend for anyone who wants a first approach to Padre Pio's history. It gives you the desire of start reading and searching about him. It's spirituality is incredible. I would watch it again and again.
1,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"The DVD's were in great condition. The DVD box was a little beaten up around the edges and there was a little folder in the front of the DVD case that was empty so it looks like something that came with the DVD was missing, but overall the product was great. It's going to make a wonderful nostalgic gift :)"
0,Not a good buy,"I am Asian, cook rice every day. I am very picky on the rice cooker that I use. I had thought that Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy would give me the best cooked rice. However, I am very dispointed. First, this rice cooker takes forever to cook. I mean twice longer than a regular simple rice cooker. Why? Because it requires 120V while we all use 110V. I dont know why the manufactur does that since it sells to U.S. Second, the texture of the rice that it cooks tastes as good as a $30.00 rice cooker. Third, the cooker use battery. Battery will die. I regret I spent $150 on this rice cooker. I should have bought the most basic one, the one that causes about $90.00. The store doesnt' let me exchange either since I already used it. Well, I just have to live with it."
0,These are full frame. Original releases were widescreen!!!,"Wake of Death and In Hell, should have been released in theaters in the U.S. Wake of Death played theaters in Europe and was a hit. In the U.S. they both could have been Van Damm's comeback films. Derailed- stinks. If your a film junkie, do not buy this triple feature. All 3 films are full screen. You really only need Wake Of Death and In Hell. I purchased both from Amazon marketplace sellers and got them cheaper than the cost of this set. In fact Wake Of Death was the best $3.00 movie I ever purchased. (.01 cent plus 2.99 for shipping) Whats funny, I am not a fan of JCVD, I just kept reading great reviews on both films and the fact that Ringo Lam and Simon Yam where involved (One of my favorite HK directors and I am a fan of Simon Yam)in the making of each film."
1,Accurate and Consistent,"First let me say that I've owned a number of highly rated step on scales that were all disappointingly inaccurate and inconsistent. This scale agrees with the one in my doctor's office, so seems to be accurate. If you get off to re-weigh yourself, it will give you the same result again. You won't gain or lose 3-5 pounds in a few seconds by getting off and on the scale, or by leaning a certain way or placing your feet in a certain spot, so it is consistent. It could be a little sturdier, but it's fine for home use. We've had it for at least a year or two with no problems. I give it 5 stars for home use."
0,Nice player except.....,"Nice player except the microSD card fails to be recognized anymore. The problem isn't the card (I've tried several), it IS the Player. The disappointing machine just fails to recognize that it even has a card slot. The expansion card slot is meaningless. And what with an appalling 90-DAY WARRANTY, you can see Sansa has little faith in their own products. It is really to be looked at as disposable. Get it really, REALLY cheap, or get something else. The rest of the machine operates fine and it pretty reasonably intuitive. But....but, the expansion card issue is a massive, strange failure. I wouldn't recommend this (or perhaps any SanDisk product. This just SHOULD NOT happen."
1,excellent for my application,I use this to push my outdoor and upstairs speakers that have a higher (needs more power) sensitivity than my living room and dining room speakers. I take the tape out feed from my main receiver and plug it into the inputs of the Amp 100. The quality is amazing for the price; this thing is solid! I don't know if it is audiophile sound but I am not using it for that purpose and not pushing audiophile quality speakers with it. The product is absolutely perfect for what I am using it for. I highly recommend it to augment a whole house music system.
1,xtreme white plus bulbs,the piaa bulbs are much brighter and whiter than OEm bulbs. Very pleased with them.
0,Still Stinking After All These Years,"I was fortunate enough to see Queen in concert 19 times during their touring days in the US, up to and including their last tour in this country in support of this piece of garbage album, Hot Space.I find it amusing reading reviews here from people who actually think it's good! I remember clearly when this album came out, how despised it was. I never met a fan of the band who liked it then, even at the concerts.Yes, this one album single handedly destroyed Queen's career here in the US, from which they would never recover. Queen never toured the states again, yet they remained tremendously popular around the rest of the world. They still made alot of good music after this diatribe of stank.Now over 20 years later....I STILL hate this album. It's awful.To the dude who thinks this junk is brilliant because it is a chick magnet, rock on, dude. It's just too bad that you don't know what Queen were all about."
0,profanity the movie!!! or profanity and the degenerates.!!!,"i cannot believe that an intelligent actor like adam sandler would degrade himself by acting in a degenerate , trailer trash movie like this,but i guess money makes some people do things that are beneath them. this movie is as funny as a sewer, all it is comprised of is endless and pointless profanity,virtually ever second word. the writer who has very little ,if not any intelligents, has substituted profanity for lack of intelligent writing.is the endless profanity suppose to make the male lead charactors appear more manly?. yes it is true that quentin tarantino movies has there fair share of profanity. however his movies use of profanity is justified as it is incorporated with intelligent writing. if you have very little or no intelligents or are a degenerate and trailer trash this movie will appeal to you."
1,Very useful eye candy...,"Yep, there are a lot of ""dream shops"" in this book. But ton's of ideas for those of us that are ""monitarilly challenged"". I found a lot of good ideas for storage and space utilization from the pictures and text. Admittedly the most of the shop layouts will not work for me, but I can sure use bits and pieces. I didn't buy this book, got it at the library, but I believe I will buy it just as a reference for ideas. Recommend it highly for just this reason."
1,Best Dirty Irish Cd ever ;),"Harry Bradley, originally from Belfast, has mastered the ""dirty"" style of Irish flute playing, where the player plays with a pulsing breath that pushes the lower octave notes to get a very distinctive tone. If you listen to Irish Flute music, you don't need me to tell you who Harry Bradley is. If you've never heard Irish flute music before, this is a great cd to start with (every Irish flute player has or belongs to a distinctive style; you can try Matt Malloy and Kevin Crawford for others). Look also for Harry's flute duet cd with Michael Clarkson, ""The Pleasures of Hope""(great stuff) and his other album ""Bad Turns and Horseshoe Bends"" is also excellent. I think you can download an mp3 to see if you like it; I recommend ""Miss Thornton's/The Primrose Lasses"", the third track on the cd which is a great set of tunes that also demonstrate the Belfast/dirty style of playing."
1,Great Product,"Works great, keeps my coffee warm while I'm at my computer. Great price and great results. I would highly recommend buying this product."
0,Rip Off of previous Book,"I'm so mad! I got this supposedly ""new"" Cookbook and when it came it looked identicall to the first cookbook expcept her picture on the front is different! I bought the same book from Sandra Lee 2 years ago!! Same damn pictures and same damn recipes are in this ""new"" Cookbook! Don't waste your money I'm returning mine today!"
1,An affordable collection,"Amazon completely understands how complicated it is to find a collection that other stores are not selling anymore. If you are looking for anything that was 10, 15, or a few decades ago, Amazon has it all. Old with the new, and new with the old."
0,Misleading,"If you are interested in learning about Saudi Arabia, this is not the book for you. It is a collection of the writer's true or imagined sexual experiences. Having lived in many countries I believe there is so much to see, learn, teach, get involved in, etc.,that focusing on sex is a waste of the experience. Writing style and vocabulary is also very simple, almost childlike. I'm almost finished with the book, and so far there is only one chapter that I found interesting."
1,good batman but not great,"i think this movie good it,s has it,s flaws bale batman ,s was better than batman forever and batman robin but this movie put,s more foucs on the comics than the batman himself the blade movies were much better. bale batman wasn,t bad but it wasn,t great. a minor comeback for DC comics it,s better the batman films that before it,s even better than superman returns because christian bale is minor star he,s not a list like the people who played batman before him. keaton was a household or become household name when he played batman i think this movie a good step bale to help his career he did me forget about superman returns . one thing he had right or this movie the joker kill did not batman pranets like in the frist batman movie ."
0,more than bad,this is for sure the badest and most boring film i have ever seen (i swear).8 women in one room for more than 5 minutes is by far too much.and everybody has to sing a chanson.this is horrible !
0,Where did the tutorials go?,"I played the game through all levels of the tutorials and advanced to 'one-on-one' with D. Trump... I did okay. Then I didn't play the game for while and when I went to play it again and get a refresher from the tutorials they were ""GONE""! Now the game will not play at all...... No help from the 'Website' either.. That is just an order site only. So I would not buy this again."
0,"Less than 3 weeks old and is a cracked, moldy piece of junk","This thing looks good in the pictures, but I immediately regret only reading the first few reviews. The negative reviews are 100% correct. I had this thing delivered on 2/16/12, and I threw it away yesterday (3/4/12), as it was cracked, peeled, and starting to mold. Do Not Buy this item."
0,Wrong Title,"This book should be titled ""How to Bend Aluminum"". It is poorly written and even worse when it comes to the useless illustrations. It has no business being advertised as a vinyl siding book, and if you should buy it, I'm sure you will find it a waste of your money as did I."
1,This is a great CD!!,"The more I listen to these songs, the more I like them. ""Only Car In Your Garage"" and ""Judy Lou"" are fun love (and fun-lovin') songs with catchy tunes. And, ""Fat Farm"" is a must for anyone who has ever battled the buldge. Dr. Fry's medicine is for the soul...see if he can't put a smile on your face!!"
0,The movie is a mute to 21 million hard of hearing people.,"There is no close caption to the movie, and it is very boring, due to not understanding what is going on without close caption. Remeber there are 21 million deaf and/or hard of hearing people in U.S.A. that depends on close caption. If ypu cut our close caption off, then the rating falls way down."
0,Come on.............,"We know Back in Black was one of the best albums in history...do we really need some ""experts"" to tell us this ??I'm a big AC/DC fan I would not buy this...."
1,The Ultimate Vanessa-Mae,"While there are some pieces on this 2003 album I didn't care for too much, I feel that there are also some excellent works too. In my opinion, Picante, Leyenda, Widescreen and Night Flight are the best works on this album and I really enjoy listening to them."
0,17 years old and it shows,"Well, I might have agreed with the other reviewers if I hadn't ordered ""Strength Ball Training"" by Goldenberg and Twist at the same time. This book seems very amateurish by today's standards. It's a thin paperback with hand-drawn sketches. Maybe this was considered okay back in 1991, but this is 2008. SBT gives you all of the exercises in this book plus many more, updated with recent training science background, illustrated with photographs of actual people, plus a DVD with videos illustrating many of the exercises! And it's the same price! Come on, get into this century. Amateur productions like this one just don't cut it anymore."
0,Ridiculous!,"I sent this unit back to Amazon! Its form factor is contrary to what it says.The camera is small, as they state, but attached to it is a bulky power cable and 9v battery connector. When you hook it all up it's huge! No longer a stealthy camera. Ridiculous!It does not serve its intended purpose.MUVI turned out to be my replacement choice. All reviews are excellent. The image is excellent and it records for hours on an internal battery. There are lots of examples on YouTube.TaosGuy"
1,Good book but took forever to get to me,"I ordered this book in March and did not receive it until June, way too long to wait for a book. The book itself is great, when it finally arrived it was in good condition. This book was recommended by one of my college professors for people who were interested in more of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's works, and is basically a utopian society novel."
1,Completely amazing!,The signer's voice is wonderful and the beat gets you moving. The lyrics are very sweet too. Between 2:06 and 2:48 there's an excellent beat rising and then it goes on with the moving beat. Any trance lover got to listen to that! :) I know some may say it's quite cheesy because of the vocals but I think it's a very good song on overall.
1,Great cd but,I gave this four stars instead of five bc the 6 song on this cd (chop suey) already skips. Other than that it's fine...but that was a bummer for sure.
1,Shakespeare's best!,"I love this play. The words are so beautiful, and the story never fails to draw me in. And I must admit that the language is hard to understand - but the New Folger Library is the way to go. I love them! They make it so easy and understandable for all of us who don't say ""wherefore"" for why. So if the language is intimidating you get the New Folger Library. But getting back to the play itself, it is fantastic, and something that everyone should read."
0,Did not fit 2004 Kia Optima LX,"I purchased this for my 2004 Kia Optima LX. When I went to install it, everything seemed good. But the car was about an inch wider than the hitch and the hitch was not centered in the car. So either the hitch was off center or the car's mounts were. Otherwise seemed like a great hitch."
1,Great read,"This book is a great read, a lot of fun. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the genre. On the down side, I think that Gault is a little too evil -- he borders on the implausible with his ability to be one step ahead of the game. Also, I think Cornwell needs to develop Dr Kay a bit more; she's a good character, but needs more depth"
1,Classic Sci-Fi,"I decided to reread the Asimov series in order. Asimov's ""Foundation series"" novels are classics of the science fiction genre. Some of the foundation novels drag on a bit but ""Foundation and Empire"" moves along well. The Asimov style emphasizes interpersonal relationships as opposed to showcasing gee-whiz science fiction apparatus. If you like science fiction you should read the foundation series novels as they are the basis of a lot of subsequent science fiction novels. Indeed, Star Wars may have been based on the Foundation novels or at least influenced their development."
0,Movie was great but Amazon's streaming on my ROKU was so poor it was hard to watch,The streaming was so poor I eventually gave up and searched for the movie on my Verizon FIOS where I watched the last 30 minutes on TNT (with commercials) where it was also playing.
1,Simply the Best!,"Since 1980, I have been recommending this reference to over 23, 000 participants in my business writing workshops. I describe the book as invaluable, comprehensive, beautifully organized, and continuously updated. The Gregg Reference Manual is one of two essential tools for business, government and corporate writers: the other is a fat dictionary. The Manual is full of wisdom and articulates sound uniform rules with nicely nuanced exceptions. It is simply my writer's crutch."
0,"Thick, dry and packed full of somewhat useful information","To read this book you need to be fully awake and have full concentration. This is not the type of book to bring to the beach. Though Richard Hofstadter makes a convincing case of what colonial times were like and he obviously was a scholar, he writes very monotonously. if not thouroughly interested in american history at 1750 i would not recommend this book. otherwise, if you are a history-fanatic, this book gives a wide range of perspectives and fully covers the history of the time."
0,WARNING - caught fire!,"Wow, pinch me is it really 2011 and we still have consumer electronics catching fire? Where is CE, UL, BS when you need them?Fortuitously I was next to the amp when the wisps of smoke started, followed by a crackling fire. The amp as spec'ed is decent and worked fine - until it decided to self-combust. The real concern is that this is configured as an 'auto-on' device, so it switches itself on when it receives an audio signal on the line-in: this means it is often going to be put somewhere out of the way and unnoticed - and that makes it a REAL fire hazard (as in 'burning the house down' hazard).So if i could give is a zero or negative star it would be duly awarded. Since now at least three reviews have indicated there is a real fire hazard, Amazon need to look carefully at what they are offering."
